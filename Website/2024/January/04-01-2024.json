Additional field hospitals are in the process, expected to be operational in the coming days. Additional equipment and personnel for field hospitals have entered the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Bakeries Resume Operations</h2>\n<p>10 bakeries in the Gaza Strip have resumed operations after the World Food Programme (WFP) has supplied flour, sugar, salt, and fuel as necessary. At the current capacity, these bakeries can bake 2 million pita breads a day. Equipment for 4 WFP warehouses has also entered the Gaza Strip, and these warehouses are expected to be set up in the coming days to enhance the logistical capacity of the organizations receiving humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Evacuation Corridor Update</h2>\n<p>As of yesterday (Jan. 4), the evacuation corridor on the Salah a-Din road is closed and has been rerouted to A-Rashid Road (Al-Bahr). The A-Rashid road (Al-Bahr) will be open for passage from northern to southern Gaza only, both for pedestrian and motorized traffic, from 09:00 to 16:00. This will also facilitate the movement of coordinated humanitarian aid trucks to northern Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Corridor on January 5</h2>\n<p>Today (Jan. 5), between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Tal a-Sultan area in Rafah, southern Gaza, to enable the movement of humanitarian aid. The evacuation corridor on the Salah a-Din road has been rerouted and remains closed, emphasizing the importance of the A-Rashid Road for the ongoing humanitarian efforts.</p>\n<p>This formatting improves readability and organizes the content into clear sections for a WordPress blog post.</p>\n",
