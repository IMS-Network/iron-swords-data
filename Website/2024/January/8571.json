It has underground, it has aboveground, it has an enemy that has prepared for a long time for defense in an organized manner, there is a population here, a lot of houses &#8211; a very, very complicated space for fighting. When we arrive to bomb such a system as you bombed in recent days here along the Tencher axis, it&#8217;s a very complicated mission, I must say &#8211; we are doing actions here that we never did before. When something bad happens, and a very bad thing happened to us here, we lost quite a few people and we had casualties. The only thing we commanders have left &#8211; learning, learning, learning. Long war, many arenas, we have many challenges, I see the capabilities here, I know very well that it can cope with any problem in Gaza, there is no square kilometer in Gaza that you can&#8217;t enter and dismantle it, there is no such thing, after what you did &#8211; there is no such thing. After what you did, there is no village in Lebanon, there is no Hezbollah in Lebanon that you can&#8217;t enter and dismantle. We&#8217;ll put you in the places needed, you will do there what&#8217;s required, long war and from the other side &#8211; we will come out with good results&#8221;.</p>\n",
