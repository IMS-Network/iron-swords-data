        "rendered": "<h1>Humanitarian Aid Efforts in Gaza: January 7-8, 2023</h1>\n<p>A total of 198 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip yesterday (Jan. 7). 121 trucks were inspected at the Nitzana crossing and transferred to the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing, while 77 trucks were inspected and transferred to Gaza via Kerem Shalom. Out of these, 113 of the trucks carried food, and the rest carried water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment.</p>\n<h2>Entry of Essential Supplies</h2>\n<p>On the same day (Jan. 7), 4 tankers of cooking gas, designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza, have entered the Gaza Strip. Following coordination and facilitation, a new field hospital in southern Gaza, operated by the International Medical Corps (IMC), has begun operating and accepting patients. </p>\n<h2>Field Hospital Capacity and Services</h2>\n<p>The field hospital has a capacity of 50 beds and a personnel of 200, providing surgical care for trauma, physical rehabilitation, emergency obstetric and newborn care, as well as advanced mental health services and more. Additional field hospitals are currently in the process of being set up, with operations expected to commence in the coming days.</p>\n<h2>Resumption of Bakery Operations</h2>\n<p>In addition, 10 bakeries in the Gaza Strip have resumed operations after the WFP supplied flour, sugar, salt, and fuel as necessary. At their current capacity, these bakeries can bake 2 million pita breads a day. Today (Jan. 8), between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in southern and western Deir Al Balach, central Gaza, to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>Field Hospitals by Various Organizations</h2>\n<p>Field hospitals donated by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates are operational, treating patients in Khan Yunis and Rafah. An additional field hospital is operated by the Red Crescent as an extension of the Al Amal hospital in Khan Yunis. A field hospital operated by the IMC has also begun treating patients in Rafah. These field hospitals bolster the medical response for the civilians in Gaza, providing necessary medical treatments.</p>\n<h2>Patient Care Statistics</h2>\n<p>The Jordanian hospital, with a capacity of 41 beds and a personnel of 154, has treated over 600 patients, while the United Arab Emirates field hospital, with a capacity of 200 beds and staffed with 100, has treated over 925 patients. The Red Crescent hospital, operating as an emergency room with a capacity of 64 beds and a personnel of 120, functions as an extension to the Al-Amal hospital. The IMC field hospital, with a capacity of 50 beds and a personnel of 200, has treated close to 500 patients and provides surgical care for trauma, physical rehabilitation, emergency obstetric and newborn care, advanced mental health services, and more.</p>\n<h2>Future Medical Responses</h2>\n<p>Additional field hospitals are currently in progress to enhance the medical response in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n",
