As the first grandchild, his arrival brought immense joy to his family. From a young age, Nir was filled with curiosity, often conducting science experiments in his quest to understand the world. At age 10, his family moved to Emek Hefer, where they became part of the Hadassah Neurim Youth Village community. Nir quickly adapted, showing intelligence, kindness, and leadership that made him beloved by peers and adults alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Military service was a proud tradition in the Binyamin family, and Nir was inspired by his relatives who served in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). He aspired to follow in their footsteps, and when the time came, Nir joined the IDF as a combat officer in the 8208 Battalion of the 261st Brigade. He was a natural leader, respected by his comrades for his courage, empathy, and strategic thinking. Nir\u2019s presence on the battlefield inspired his fellow soldiers, who saw him as both a protector and a friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While serving in the IDF, Nir also pursued his academic dreams. He studied electrical engineering at Bar-Ilan University, where he met Naomi, the love of his life. Together, they built a life in Givatayim, dreaming of a future filled with love and family. Nir&#8217;s devotion to Naomi was matched by his love for his family, especially his younger sister, Avia, with whom he shared a deep bond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, Nir\u2019s life was cut short during a mission in the Gaza Strip in January, a loss that took 20 other reservist soldiers. His death sent shockwaves through his community and left his family and friends heartbroken. At Nir\u2019s funeral in Kfar Vitkin, his parents, Michal and Ofer, and sister Avia, along with Naomi, mourned deeply. Nir was celebrated not only as a heroic soldier but as a loving son, brother, fianc\u00e9, and friend who impacted countless lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nir&#8217;s aunt, Aliza, described him as a person of exceptional character, committed to his family and country. His death was not only a personal tragedy but a national loss, highlighting the sacrifices made by IDF soldiers. Nir&#8217;s father, Ofer, shared a poignant story of Nir&#8217;s unwavering sense of duty: despite the dangers and weariness of war, Nir remained committed to serving his country, telling his father, \u201cIf I don\u2019t fight, who will?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His aunt, Galit Bokris, delivered a heartfelt eulogy, describing Nir as more than a nephew\u2014he was like a son. Her words echoed the feelings of everyone who knew him: &#8220;He was a brilliant, sensitive, and generous soul\u2014a true gentleman and a warrior. His loss leaves us shattered.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the weeks following his passing, the community\u2019s outpouring of support brought some comfort to Nir&#8217;s family. Many shared stories of Nir&#8217;s heroism and kindness, highlighting the profound impact he had on those around him. This collective memory helped ease the pain of their unimaginable loss and served as a testament to Nir\u2019s enduring legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To honor Nir\u2019s memory, his family established a scholarship at Bar-Ilan University to support students pursuing engineering degrees, reflecting Nir\u2019s passion for knowledge and innovation. Though Nir&#8217;s time on earth was brief, the impact he made was profound, leaving a legacy of courage, love, and service that continues to inspire others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nir Binyamin&#8217;s story is a powerful reminder of the extraordinary potential within each of us to make a difference. His life, marked by integrity and purpose, exemplified courage and compassion. Remembering Nir honors not only his achievements but also the ideals he stood for. His legacy is a beacon of hope, emphasizing the enduring power of love and the strength found in unity and perseverance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reflecting on Nir&#8217;s life, we are reminded of the preciousness of each moment and the impact we can have on the world. Though his journey ended too soon, Nir\u2019s story will continue to inspire and guide us, urging us to live with purpose, serve with honor, and love without limits. In the hearts of those who knew and loved him, Nir Binyamin will forever be remembered as a hero, a beloved son, a cherished brother, and a dear friend\u2014a life remembered, a legacy cherished.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><a class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></a></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Nir </h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Binyamin</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">29</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">22 January 2024</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Gaza Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Captain (res.)</h2>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
