        "rendered": "\n<p>UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) has once again been exposed for its undeniable association with terrorism following recent operations conducted by the IDF in western Khan Yunis. The agency, under the guise of humanitarian work, continues to be implicated in aiding terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, betraying its publicly stated mission and reinforcing its role as a facilitator of violence and destabilization in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discovery of Weapons in UNRWA Bags</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>During a targeted raid by the 7th Brigade on a weapons production facility used by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization, IDF troops uncovered an alarming reality: numerous weapons and explosive devices were concealed inside UNRWA-marked bags. This cache included Kalashnikov rifles, RPG warheads, weapons magazines, IEDs, and hand grenades. The presence of these items, directly linked to a UN-associated organization, is an irrefutable testament to UNRWA\u2019s complicity in terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Weapons Production Site and Tunnel Network</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF\u2019s operation not only revealed the stockpiling of weapons but also led to the dismantling of a workshop where long-range rockets, anti-tank missiles, mines, and other explosive devices were manufactured. Additionally, an underground tunnel route within the compound, likely used for smuggling and militant movement, was identified and destroyed. These findings struck a critical blow to the Islamic Jihad\u2019s capabilities and raised significant questions about how UNRWA\u2019s resources and logistics continue to be leveraged by these terrorist groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">UNRWA: A Terrorist Collaborator in Plain Sight</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA\u2019s repeated involvement in such findings highlights a disturbing truth: it functions not as a humanitarian organization but as an enabler of terror, funded and operated by the United Nations. Far from being an impartial body, UNRWA&#8217;s operations facilitate militant activities, from smuggling weapons and building tunnel networks to shielding terrorists under the cover of civilian aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agency\u2019s association with Hamas and other terror groups is not new. Evidence has repeatedly shown that its facilities are used as storage for arms, recruitment centers, and training grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of weapons in UNRWA-labeled bags should be a wake-up call for the global community. The continued funding and operation of such an organization without stringent oversight and reform only bolster the efforts of groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, allowing them to act with impunity. If UNRWA remains unchecked, its resources will continue to fuel violence, putting both Israeli and Gazan civilian lives at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is imperative that international bodies acknowledge the role UNRWA plays in this cycle of violence. True humanitarian aid cannot coexist with terrorism. The exposure of these connections must lead to comprehensive action, holding UNRWA accountable for its involvement and ensuring that aid channels are not manipulated to support terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s consistent efforts to reveal and neutralize these threats are not only acts of national defense but a crucial push toward exposing the true nature of UNRWA. The world must respond by reassessing the role of UNRWA, pushing for stringent reforms or replacement, and recognizing that support for such an entity in its current state is tantamount to complicity in terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure
