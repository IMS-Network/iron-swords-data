This is to facilitate the UN&#8217;s distribution of goods on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom and the reception on the Egyptian side of Rafah.</p>\n<h2>Recent Deliveries to Gaza</h2>\n<p>Yesterday, (Jan. 20) 4 tankers of cooking gas and 2 tankers of fuel designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza entered the Gaza Strip. Additionally, 4 warehouses are in the process of establishment to enhance the logistic capacity of the international organizations receiving humanitarian aid within the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Coordination Efforts</h2>\n<p>31 foreign nationals are coordinated for exit today. The coordination for the repair of vital infrastructure was successfully completed. Furthermore, additional equipment and personnel for the field hospitals operating in the Gaza Strip also entered. So far, a total of 341 staffers have entered the Gaza Strip to bolster the medical response in the region.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Aid Operations</h2>\n<p>Today, (Jan. 21) between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Al-Idari neighborhood in Rafah, southern Gaza, to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
