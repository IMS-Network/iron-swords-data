        "rendered": "<h2>Humanitarian Operations Update in Gaza</h2>\n<p>In line with the agreement reached with the US, Egypt, and the UN, Kerem Shalom and Nitzana crossings will be closed on Saturdays. This is to facilitate the UN&#8217;s distribution of goods on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom and the reception on the Egyptian side of Rafah.</p>\n<h3>Humanitarian Aid Delivery</h3>\n<p>A truck convoy made up of 10 trucks carrying humanitarian aid was successfully coordinated and transferred to shelters in northern Gaza. Yesterday, (Jan. 27), 4 tankers of cooking gas and 1 tanker of fuel designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza have entered the Gaza Strip. Tens of thousands of Gazans moved west of Khan Yunis in the corridor for humanitarian purposes that the IDF has opened. Additionally, 16 trucks that made their way from Jordan were transferred to the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h3>Coordination Efforts</h3>\n<p>On January 27, 244 foreign nationals were coordinated for exit. Furthermore, 7 ambulances, donated by Turkey, were transferred to the Gaza Strip after inspection. Four warehouses have been established to enhance the logistic capacity of the international organizations receiving humanitarian aid within the Gaza Strip. The coordination for the repair of vital infrastructure has been successfully completed, with 12 bakeries providing 2 million pita breads a day now operational.</p>\n<h3>Pause for Aid Movement</h3>\n<p>Today, (Jan. 28), between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the western neighborhood in Rafah, southern Gaza, in order to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h3>Field Hospitals</h3>\n<p>A French floating hospital has arrived at the Al-Arish port and will be docked there for a month. Gazan patients are exiting the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing for treatment. So far, over 2,000 patients have been treated and advised on the ship. On Jan. 28, the French vessel completed its mission and returned to its country of origin.</p>\n<h3>Medical Efforts</h3>\n<p>Seventy-four ambulances entered the Gaza Strip to bolster first responder capabilities. The breakdown of donations is as follows: 28 ambulances from Kuwait, 2 from Egypt, 8 from Qatar, 29 from Saudi Arabia, and 7 from Turkey.</p>\n<p>Currently, the IDF is carrying out precise operations against the Hamas terrorist organization in Khan Yunis. IDF intelligence indicates that Hamas terrorists are operating from inside and around the Nasser hospital and Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis. The IDF has been liaising with the hospital directors and medical staff, both on the phone and on the ground, to ensure that the hospitals can remain operational and accessible.</p>\n<p>Before the commencement of our operations in the area, proactive measures were taken to ensure that the hospitals had sufficient fuel and supplies to maintain functionality throughout the duration of our operation against Hamas.</p>\n",
