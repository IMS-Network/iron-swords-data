Despite the challenges of starting over in a new country, Sergey built a successful life through determination and hard work. He was the son of Isak, who tragically died when Sergey was just seven years old, and Ella. Growing up without a father deeply influenced Sergey\u2019s character, instilling in him a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to his own family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Family Life</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergey married Marina, whom he met during their military service in a &#8220;Nativ&#8221; course. The couple had two children, Roy and Tal. Sergey was a devoted father who prioritized his children in every aspect of his life. His love for his family was evident in his actions, whether it was playing with his children, helping them with their schoolwork, or simply being present in their lives. Sergey was affectionately known as &#8220;Super Dad&#8221; for his unwavering dedication to giving his children the love and support he had missed out on during his own childhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Military Service and Heroic Sacrifice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergey served as a First Sergeant (Res.) in the 261st Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces. On October 7, 2023, after Hamas terrorists launched a brutal and unprovoked attack on Israel, Sergey was called into action. He joined a mission to rescue innocent hostages who had been abducted by Hamas during the massacre. This mission was part of Israel&#8217;s broader effort to protect its citizens from the barbaric acts of terrorism committed by Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 22, 2024, during a critical operation in southern Gaza aimed at rescuing these hostages, Sergey and his unit were in a building that was struck by an RPG rocket fired by a Hamas terrorist. The impact caused the building to collapse, resulting in the tragic deaths of Sergey and 20 of his comrades. This incident, later known as the &#8220;Building Collapse in Al-Muazi,&#8221; was a devastating loss for Israel and a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Professional Life and Personal Achievements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of his military service, Sergey was a man of many talents. He had recently transitioned from being a bodyguard for ministers to working as an independent financial and pension planner. Sergey was determined to succeed in his new career, completing the necessary exams with great effort and dedication. Tragically, Sergey received his license only weeks before his death, and he had just begun a new job that he was excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remembering Sergey</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sergey was known for his generosity, intelligence, and infectious sense of humor. His friends and colleagues admired him for his ability to bring light to even the darkest situations, whether through a joke or a kind gesture. In the military, Sergey was respected and loved by his comrades for his unwavering courage and his ability to lift the spirits of those around him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marina, Sergey\u2019s wife, remembers him as an incredible partner and father. Their nearly 16 years together were filled with love, laughter, and shared passions like skiing and sports. Sergey was a man who gave his all to his family and his country, and his loss is deeply felt by all who knew him.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Sergey</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Guntmacher</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">37</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">22 January 2024</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Gaza Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Sergeant major (res.)</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
