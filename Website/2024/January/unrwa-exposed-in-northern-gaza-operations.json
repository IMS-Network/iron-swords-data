    "content": {
        "rendered": "\n<p>In ongoing operations over the past few weeks, the IDF\u2019s Nahal Brigade combat team from the 162nd Division, supported by the Intelligence Directorate and specialized units, has been strategically engaged in the Daraj Tuffah area of northern Gaza. These operations unveiled crucial infrastructure linked to Hamas&#8217;s extensive military preparations, revealing yet another example of UNRWA\u2019s troubling involvement in supporting terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discovery of Tunnel Networks and Weapons Production</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>During these operations, IDF troops uncovered a strategic tunnel shaft leading to a 100-meter-long tunnel that housed an active weapons production site. This discovery highlights the embedded nature of Hamas\u2019s military apparatus within Gaza\u2019s civilian landscape. What\u2019s most concerning is that these facilities were connected with findings that exposed UNRWA\u2019s resources being intertwined with terror operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iranian Influence and Technological Transfers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Intelligence collected during the operation confirmed that Hamas operatives received critical training and technological guidance from Iranian experts. This support enabled Hamas to develop and construct advanced weaponry, amplifying the threat posed by these terrorist forces. This finding not only underscores the direct link between Iran and Hamas but also raises questions about how UNRWA facilitates an environment conducive to such training and military escalation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Combat and Tactical Engagements</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>IDF troops encountered intense resistance, including close-quarters combat that led to the elimination of several militants. Supported by precision air strikes, the IDF successfully targeted key operatives while maintaining strict measures to minimize civilian harm. This aspect of the operation showcased Israel\u2019s continued commitment to balancing the imperative of defense with the challenges of fighting an enemy deeply embedded within civilian and humanitarian settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">UNRWA\u2019s Involvement</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most revealing aspect of the raid was the discovery of UNRWA identification documents and related items within the area. This is not an isolated incident but part of an ongoing pattern that points to UNRWA\u2019s deep entanglement with Hamas. Whether through willful negligence or active complicity, the presence of UNRWA-labeled resources at sites of military significance cannot be ignored. The organization, purportedly focused on humanitarian aid, has shown time and again that its resources are exploited to mask and support terrorist activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These findings further reinforce the urgent need for comprehensive scrutiny of UNRWA\u2019s operations in Gaza. The connection between UNRWA\u2019s resources and terrorist activities lays bare the organization&#8217;s failure to maintain neutrality and uphold its humanitarian mandate. This situation calls for immediate reform and oversight to prevent aid and international organizations from being weaponized by terror groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence from the Daraj Tuffah operation serves as a stark warning of the grave challenges Israel faces. The world must respond with awareness and action to ensure that organizations like UNRWA are held accountable and prevented from facilitating any further misuse of humanitarian resources. Israel\u2019s resolve in defending its citizens remains unwavering, as it continues to expose and dismantle the complex network of threats emanating from Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Findings Located by the Nahal Brigade in the Daraj Tuffah Area\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bap3VKIpyhc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",
