Additionally, <strong>145 trucks</strong> were distributed by aid organizations inside Gaza. We facilitated a World Food Programme (WFP) truck convoy directly to northern Gaza as part of our ongoing efforts to enable aid access into and across the region.</p>\n<h3>Truck Convoy Operations</h3>\n<p>A convoy consisting of <strong>21 trucks</strong> made its way to northern Gaza last night. Over the past three weeks, more than <strong>150 trucks</strong> have been transferred to the northern Gaza Strip, with most being facilitated by the private sector.</p>\n<h3>Additional Aid Deliveries</h3>\n<p>Yesterday, March 13, <strong>4 tankers</strong> of cooking gas, essential for the operation of vital infrastructure in Gaza, successfully entered the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, <strong>94 packages</strong> were airdropped by Jordan on the same day.</p>\n<h3>International Collaboration</h3>\n<p>Since the onset of the war, and in cooperation with nations including the USA, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Holland, Belgium, and France, over <strong>30 airdrops</strong> have occurred, delivering over <strong>1250 packages</strong> of humanitarian aid, mostly targeting northern Gaza.</p>\n<h3>Patient Exits and Local Support</h3>\n<p>Today, ill and wounded patients are expected to exit the Gaza Strip, following the exit of <strong>68 foreign nationals</strong> yesterday, March 13. Additionally, <strong>20 bakeries</strong> are currently operational in Gaza, producing over <strong>2 million</strong> breads, rolls, and pita breads each day for the local population.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure Repairs and Humanitarian Aid Coordination</h3>\n<p>The coordination for the repair of vital infrastructure in Gaza has been successfully completed. Today, March 14, between <strong>10:00 and 14:00</strong>, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) will pause operations in the Al-Shabora neighborhood of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip to facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
