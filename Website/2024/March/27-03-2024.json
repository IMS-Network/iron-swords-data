Of these, <strong>116 trucks</strong> were distributed within Gaza by UN aid agencies. Additionally, <strong>25 food aid trucks</strong> coordinated by the private sector were sent to northern Gaza, and <strong>25 aid trucks</strong> were transferred to Gaza via the Jordanian route.</p>\n<h2>Airdrops and Essential Supplies</h2>\n<p>On March 26, <strong>125 packages</strong> (1 ton each) of humanitarian aid were airdropped over northern Gaza. Furthermore, 4 tankers of cooking gas and 4 tankers of fuel, designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza, entered the Gaza Strip on the same day. In addition, 4 mobile desalination units were transferred to the Gaza Strip. These units are expected to supply <strong>2-3 liters of water per day</strong> to tens of thousands of people in the Rafah area. This aid is in addition to the Emirati water line from Egypt.</p>\n<h2>Future Exits and Local Support</h2>\n<p>Today, (Mar. 27), <strong>23 foreign nationals</strong> are expected to exit Gaza. Currently, <strong>21 bakeries</strong> are operational in Gaza, providing over <strong>2 million breads, rolls, and pita breads</strong> a day for the local population.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Pause by IDF</h2>\n<p>Today, (Mar. 27), between <strong>10:00 and 14:00</strong>, the IDF will pause operations in the western neighborhood in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
