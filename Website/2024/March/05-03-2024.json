Additionally, this morning, 50 incubators designated for hospitals in the northern and southern Gaza Strip have entered Gaza. These incubators, donated by UNICEF, will be delivered to the following hospitals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shifa Hospital</li>\n<li>Kamal Adwan Hospital</li>\n<li>European Hospital</li>\n<li>Nasser Hospital</li>\n<li>Aqsa Hospital</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Food and Supplies</h2>\n<p>A convoy carrying food was coordinated to the northern Gaza Strip. Over the last few days, more than 100 trucks were transferred to the northern region. In the past week, 302 packages carrying humanitarian aid were airdropped over Gaza. On the same day (March 4), 91 foreign nationals successfully exited the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Fuel and Gas Imports</h2>\n<p>Also yesterday, four tankers of cooking gas and three tankers of fuel designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza were allowed to enter the Gaza Strip. Notably, a United Arab Emirates floating hospital docked at the El-Arish port on February 22 and has begun receiving Gazan patients for treatment.</p>\n<h2>Bakeries and Bread Production</h2>\n<p>Currently, 20 bakeries are operational in Gaza, providing over 2.5 million breads, rolls, and pita breads daily for the local population. Over the last two weeks, the number of operational bakeries has increased from 10 to 12, then to 15, and now to 20, following the facilitation from COGAT.</p>\n<h2>Infrastructure Repairs and Humanitarian Aid Coordination</h2>\n<p>The coordination of the repair of vital infrastructure was successfully completed. Today (March 5), between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Sheikh Al-Yamini-west neighborhood in Deir Al Balah, central Gaza Strip, to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
