We facilitated a WFP truck convoy directly to northern Gaza. This is part of our ongoing efforts to facilitate aid into and across Gaza.</p>\n<h3>Recent Aid Efforts</h3>\n<p>Over the last 2 weeks, more than 150 trucks were transferred to the northern Gaza Strip, most by the private sector. Yesterday (Mar. 12), 4 tankers of cooking gas and 2 tankers of fuel designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza have entered the Gaza Strip. </p>\n<h3>Coordinations and Airdrops</h3>\n<p>Yesterday (Mar. 12), 10 coordinations were submitted, 9 were approved, and one was postponed by the coordinating body. Additionally, 72 packages were airdropped by Jordan yesterday (Mar. 12). Since the start of the war, and in cooperation with the USA, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Holland, Belgium, and France, over 30 airdrops have taken place, airdropping over 1250 packages of humanitarian aid, most to northern Gaza.</p>\n<h3>Foreign Nationals Exiting Gaza</h3>\n<p>46 foreign nationals exited the Gaza Strip yesterday (Mar. 12). 68 foreign nationals are expected to exit today.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure and Bakery Operations</h3>\n<p>2 field hospitals are in the process of establishment. 20 bakeries are operational in Gaza, providing over 2 million breads, rolls, and pita breads a day for the local population.
