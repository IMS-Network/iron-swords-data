This was in accordance with the government&#8217;s decision. Twelve WCK trucks distributed the aid to the northern Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Coordinated Efforts for Aid Distribution</h2>\n<p>In line with the agreement reached with the US, Egypt, and the UN, the Kerem Shalom and Nitzana crossings will be closed on Saturdays. This is to facilitate the UN&#8217;s distribution of the goods on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom and the reception on the Egyptian side of Rafah.</p>\n<p>Sixty-one trucks were distributed by aid organizations, and a convoy of 12 trucks made its way to northern Gaza last night. Over the last 3 weeks, more than 150 trucks were transferred to the northern Gaza Strip, most by the private sector.</p>\n<h3>Recent Supplies and Aid Deliveries</h3>\n<p>On <strong>Mar. 16</strong>, four tankers of cooking gas and two tankers of fuel designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza entered the Gaza Strip. Humanitarian aid trucks also entered Gaza via the Jordan delivery route.</p>\n<p>Additionally, five water pumping facilities supplying water to over 200,000 residents in northern Gaza were refueled on the same day, following coordination efforts.</p>\n<h2>Airdrops and Support Initiatives</h2>\n<p>Yesterday, <strong>Mar. 16</strong>, 96 packages were airdropped by Jordan. Since the start of the war, and in cooperation with the USA, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Holland, Belgium, and France, over 30 airdrops have taken place, airdropping over 1250 packages of humanitarian aid, most of which were directed to northern Gaza.</p>\n<h3>Medical Evacuations and Bakery Operations</h3>\n<p>Ill and wounded patients exited the Gaza Strip yesterday, with more expected to exit today. Additionally, 20 bakeries are operational in Gaza, providing over 2 million breads, rolls, and pita breads a day for the local population.</p>\n<h2>Temporary Lull for Humanitarian Aid</h2>\n<p>Today, <strong>Mar. 17</strong>, between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Rafah Refugee camp in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, in order to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
