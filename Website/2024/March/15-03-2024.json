Among these, <strong>174 trucks</strong> were transferred via Kerem Shalom and <strong>70 trucks</strong> via Nitzana. A total of <strong>171 trucks</strong> were distributed by aid organizations inside Gaza. Additionally, a convoy of <strong>31 trucks</strong> made its way to northern Gaza last night.</p>\n<h2>Transfer of Fuel and Gas</h2>\n<p>Over the last 3 weeks, more than <strong>150 trucks</strong> were transferred to the northern Gaza Strip, with most of these being handled by the private sector. On yesterday&#8217;s date (Mar. 14), <strong>4 tankers of cooking gas</strong> and <strong>3 tankers of fuel</strong> designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza have entered the territory.</p>\n<h2>Maritime and Airdrop Assistance</h2>\n<p>Humanitarian aid trucks also entered Gaza via the Jordan delivery route, and in the coming days, assistance delivered through the maritime route will be received in Gaza. Notably, <strong>94 packages</strong> were airdropped by Jordan yesterday (Mar. 14). Since the commencement of the war, and in collaboration with the USA, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Holland, Belgium, and France, over <strong>30 airdrops</strong> took place, delivering more than <strong>1250 packages</strong> of humanitarian aid, primarily to northern Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Medical Evacuations and Local Support</h2>\n<p>Dozens of ill and wounded patients exited the Gaza Strip yesterday, with more expected to exit today. Additionally, <strong>20 bakeries</strong> are currently operational in Gaza, providing over <strong>2 million</strong> breads, rolls, and pita breads each day for the local population. The coordination for the repair and refuel of vital infrastructure was successfully completed during this period.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Aid Movement Today</h2>\n<p>Today, (Mar. 15), between <strong>10:00 and 14:00</strong>, the IDF will pause operations in the Tal-Al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, in order to facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<p></body><br />\n</html></p>\n",
