The Israeli Foreign Ministry has informed the United Nations in writing that it is ending its cooperation with UNRWA. Israel has every right to do this.<br>In 1967, after The Six-Day War, Israel and UNRWA exchanged letters. Israel agreed to cooperate with UNRWA under a provisional agreement, which it explicitly stated could be replaced or canceled. After nearly 60 years of cooperation, Israel has now canceled this agreement.<br>Despite having \u201cUN\u201d in its name, UNRWA is a Palestinian organization that has been infiltrated and compromised by Hamas. The United Nations has refused to address this issue, leading to the Israeli Parliament\u2019s vote to sever ties with UNRWA.<br>The UNRWA ban will take effect in three months. During this time, Israel intends to work with other international aid agencies, including UN bodies that are not compromised by Hamas. UNRWA must move out, and real aid organizations need to move in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Updates from Northern Gaza</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tons of Hamas terrorists are making their final stand in Northern Gaza. Israel is conducting a major military operation in the region, aiming to prevent Hamas terrorists from regrouping and rearming to carry out further massacres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF has:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Killed around 900 Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detained approximately 300 terrorists involved in the October 7th Massacre, including those who played logistical roles, fired rockets, or attacked soldiers in Gaza.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These individuals are terrorists who must be removed from the battlefield.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hamas\u2019 Use of Hospitals</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas terrorists are using hospitals as military bases. They hide there, knowing that the IDF avoids entering hospitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Last week, Hamas barricaded itself in Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The IDF entered, apprehending 100 Hamas terrorists, some of whom attempted to blend in with civilians evacuating the hospital.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas also uses hospitals to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hold hostages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plan attacks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Store weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, the IDF coordinated the evacuation of staff and patients from Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda Hospitals to other facilities. Humanitarian aid, including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies, was provided to these hospitals to maintain their operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the convoy passed Kamal Adwan, terrorists detonated a bomb nearby. While the convoy was unharmed, six children in the hospital were injured, and the hospital\u2019s roof and courtyard were damaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas\u2019 use of hospitals as terror bases is a war crime. Yet organizations like the World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders, and the Red Cross remain silent.<br>The Associated Press recently claimed Israel is targeting Gaza\u2019s hospitals, alleging an \u201copen campaign\u201d on medical facilities. These claims ignore extensive evidence that Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas is a barbaric terrorist army that has committed some of the greatest crimes against humanity. It continues to hold 101 Israeli hostages in underground terror dungeons and has no red lines, including using hospitals to wage war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s goal remains the destruction of Hamas\u2019 military and governmental capabilities and the safe return of all hostages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What\u2019s Israel\u2019s plan for returning northern residents to their homes?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Prime Minister Netanyahu recently outlined a three-point plan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Push Hezbollah beyond the Litani River in southern Lebanon.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prevent Hezbollah from rearming.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respond forcefully to any threats.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Diplomatic solutions are preferable, but if Hezbollah remains near the border, Israel\u2019s military operation will continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How is Israel addressing ballistic missile threats from Iran?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Iran has already fired hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel this year. In response, Israel has targeted Iran\u2019s air defenses. If Iran fires more missiles, Israel is prepared to respond with greater force inside Iran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> With ties to UNRWA severed, what\u2019s Israel\u2019s plan for humanitarian aid in Gaza?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Other international organizations, such as UNHCR and USAID, are capable of stepping in. Israel has a three-month window for these agencies to develop a plan for aid delivery to Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What resources are used to prepare the daily briefing?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Sources include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Official press releases and statements from Israeli government agencies (e.g., PMO, IDF).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Israeli newspapers in English and Hebrew.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commentary from journalists and analysts globally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination ensures accurate and diverse perspectives for the daily briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing Statement</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining the Israeli Citizen Spokesperson\u2019s Office daily briefing. We are live every weekday, Sunday to Thursday, at 3 PM Israel time (8 AM EST).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I\u2019m Daniel Rubenstein. Have a lovely day.</em></p>\n",
