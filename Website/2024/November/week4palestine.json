Their alleged involvement in planning and promoting terror reveals a shocking truth: <strong>#Week4Palestine is not a peace movement; it is an enabler of hate and violence.</strong> Under the guise of supporting Palestinian rights, this group has chosen to spread terror, openly showing support for brutal, antisemitic acts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports from Amsterdam describe a coordinated wave of attacks on Jewish people, with Jews ambushed, thrown into rivers, and even run over by cars. Disturbingly, Palestinian militants armed with weapons reportedly terrorized Jewish families, stole passports, and incited widespread chaos. Muslim migrants allegedly participated in hotel break-ins, threw incendiary devices, and desecrated Israeli flags. <strong>These horrific actions mirror the violent tactics employed by terrorist groups like Hamas, and #Week4Palestine has been accused of not only endorsing but also actively organizing these brutal acts.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To support or follow #Week4Palestine is to stand with terror.</strong> Any individual or organization that aids, organizes, or sympathizes with violent acts like those committed in Amsterdam directly endorses the targeting of innocent civilians. Those who continue to lend credibility or resources to <strong>#Week4Palestine</strong> align themselves with terror organizations that celebrate violence, inflict fear, and pursue agendas rooted in hate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do not be deceived. Supporting #Week4Palestine means endorsing terror.</strong> Their actions speak louder than their slogans: they are aligned with hatred and bloodshed, not justice or peace.</p>\n",
