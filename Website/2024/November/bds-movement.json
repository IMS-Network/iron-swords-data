While it masquerades as a movement for \u201chuman rights,\u201d its true agenda is rooted in antisemitism and the complete delegitimization of the world\u2019s only Jewish state. BDS doesn\u2019t seek peace or coexistence; it seeks the dismantling of Israel through economic warfare, cultural isolation, and outright lies designed to turn the world against it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Led by the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), BDS uses propaganda to push for boycotts of Israeli goods, sanctions on its government, and divestment from any company that does business with Israel. The goal? To choke Israel economically, ostracize it diplomatically, and isolate it culturally until it can no longer defend itself. This isn\u2019t about a two-state solution\u2014it\u2019s about obliterating the Jewish state entirely. BDS leaders have made this clear time and again, with statements rejecting Israel\u2019s right to exist and demanding the so-called \u201cright of return,\u201d which would turn Israel into yet another Arab-majority state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BDS doesn\u2019t just harm Israel\u2014it spreads hate and division globally. It singles out Israel for supposed \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d while ignoring the atrocities committed by countries like Iran, Syria, and China. It\u2019s no coincidence that BDS rhetoric mirrors the language of terrorist organizations like Hamas, which openly call for the destruction of Israel. By targeting Israeli businesses, academic institutions, and even individual artists, BDS works hand-in-hand with extremists who seek to demonize and dismantle Israel. Worse, its campaigns have fueled antisemitic attacks worldwide, creating a hostile environment for Jews everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make no mistake: the BDS movement is not a movement for justice. It is a movement for hate, destruction, and the eradication of Israel. Its real aim is to delegitimize the Jewish people\u2019s right to self-determination and support the very forces that promote violence and terror against innocent Israelis. By backing BDS, its supporters align themselves with a cause that seeks not peace, but the annihilation of a nation and its people.</p>\n",
