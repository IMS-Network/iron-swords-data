Here\u2019s what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said yesterday:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cHamas has once again refused to release even a limited number of hostages to secure a ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas doesn\u2019t want to end the war. Hamas wants to end Israel. The more hardship Gazans endure, the better for Hamas, as it galvanizes international support against Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7th, Hamas committed atrocities, murdering children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. This war cannot end with Hamas intact. To ensure peace, three steps are essential:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Destroy Hamas</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Demilitarize Gaza</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Deradicalize Gazan society</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel\u2019s Progress in Gaza</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli troops have continued operations in Northern Gaza to dismantle remnants of Hamas. Over the past year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hamas\u2019 battalions across Gaza were dismantled piece by piece.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Major strongholds, including Gaza City, the central strip, Khan Yunis, and Rafah, were neutralized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Hamas\u2019 underground tunnel network\u2014a massive \u201cinfrastructure of death\u201d\u2014remains to be destroyed. Additionally, Hamas is attempting to rebuild its forces by recruiting young fighters, often paid with money obtained by selling humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recent IDF Operations Include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Capturing 100 Hamas terrorists hiding in Kamal Adwan Hospital.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detaining 300 Hamas terrorists in Northern Gaza in the last month.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Killing 900 Hamas fighters in combat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Humanitarian Aid and Challenges</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite ongoing combat, Israel coordinated with Gazan medical staff to ensure:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Civilians were evacuated from hospitals safely.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ambulances were not exploited to transport terrorists.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel has delivered significant humanitarian aid, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>172 trucks of supplies since June.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30,000 liters of fuel to Kamal Adwan Hospital.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blood and medical supplies to Al-Awda Hospital.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Hamas continues to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prevent civilians from evacuating.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exploit humanitarian aid for personal gain.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use hospitals as military bases and storage facilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> An official confirmed that the Prime Minister offered millions of dollars to Hamas terrorists for releasing hostages. What are your thoughts?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a tragedy. Despite offers of money, free passage, and other incentives, no Gazan civilian has stepped forward with information on the hostages. Moral clarity is absent among Hamas terrorists, and this should be condemned by the international community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is enough humanitarian aid reaching Northern Gaza?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> The issue isn\u2019t Israel blocking aid but Hamas intercepting it. Approximately 700 trucks are stuck at the border because aid workers are either complicit with Hamas, too afraid to act, or aiming to portray Israel as withholding aid. Hamas steals humanitarian supplies to sell for profit, recruit fighters, and strengthen itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> UNIFIL claims Israel has attacked them. What\u2019s happening in Lebanon?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> UNIFIL was tasked with enforcing peace in southern Lebanon and disarming Hezbollah as per UN resolutions. However, it has failed, often facing threats and attacks from Hezbollah itself\u2014not Israel. Israel has no interest in targeting UNIFIL and stands by its commitment to regional peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What defines the eradication of Hamas in Gaza?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Hamas\u2019 military hierarchy has been dismantled, but thousands of terrorists remain, terrorizing civilians and exploiting resources. Destroying their tunnel network and ensuring their inability to regroup are essential. However, this is a long-term effort requiring continued military action and possibly external assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do you stay optimistic amidst this conflict?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Optimism comes from faith in God, belief in the resilience of the Jewish people, and confidence that humanity will recognize the threat posed by groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. They are not just against Israel but against humanity and the values we all cherish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing Statement</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining me today. We\u2019ll be live again at 3 PM tomorrow.</p>\n",
