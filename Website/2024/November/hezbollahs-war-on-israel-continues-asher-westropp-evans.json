Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Israel Katz as Defense Minister and Benny Gantz as Foreign Minister. While this may spark questions globally, the critical point remains unchanged:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Israel continues to fight for survival in a seven-front war.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The message from Israel today is the same as yesterday:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hamas must be dismantled.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hostages must be returned.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hezbollah must be pushed back.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran\u2019s war on Israel continues, with its terror proxy Hezbollah launching deadly attacks on Israeli cities. At 11:23 AM today, as I prepared this broadcast, phones buzzed with alerts of a rocket attack targeting Tel Aviv. This has become alarmingly normal in Israel, but it\u2019s anything but normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Scope of the Conflict</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since October 8th, Hezbollah has launched nearly <strong>16,000 Iranian rockets, missiles, and drones</strong> at Israel. This relentless barrage has displaced over <strong>60,000 Israelis</strong>, many of whom remain unable to return to their homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>United Nations\u2019 failure</strong> to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1701 has allowed Hezbollah to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fortify positions along Israel\u2019s border.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stockpile hundreds of thousands of rockets.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Continue arms shipments from Iran through Syria.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel has responded by targeting Hezbollah\u2019s weapons facilities in Syria, striking key sites three times this week alone. Israeli citizen soldiers are now disarming Hezbollah incrementally, as no one else has taken action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Humanitarian Aid to Gaza</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While fighting continues, Israel has facilitated unprecedented levels of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Since Hamas\u2019 October 7th Massacre:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Aid deliveries have tripled compared to pre-war levels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yesterday, <strong>206 truckloads of aid</strong> were collected by COGAT (Israel\u2019s agency responsible for Gaza aid).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, over <strong>600 truckloads of aid remain undelivered</strong>, awaiting collection on the Gazan side of the border. Aid organizations must address this failure instead of blaming Israel for Hamas\u2019 actions, which prioritize war over Gaza\u2019s civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is Israel expecting from an incoming Trump Administration?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Israel expects continuity in the longstanding US-Israel relationship. This partnership is rooted in mutual support, shared democratic values, and collective security against adversaries like Iran. Regardless of who is in the White House, Israel hopes this critical alliance will continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> If UN Resolution 1701 is implemented, will Hezbollah\u2019s rockets still threaten Tel Aviv?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Hezbollah possesses long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching deep into Israel, including Tel Aviv. While moving Hezbollah back to the Litani River would provide a buffer, it wouldn\u2019t eliminate the threat entirely. Israel\u2019s missile defense systems, while effective, cannot offer complete security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> A former Iranian official said Iran is close to achieving a nuclear bomb. What are your thoughts?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions are a dire threat. Allowing Iran\u2014a tyrannical, theocratic regime\u2014to become nuclear-armed would destabilize the world. Israel, alongside allies like the US, must continue efforts to ensure Iran does not achieve this capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Are the 60,000 evacuees in northern Israel any closer to returning home?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Unfortunately, no. Northern Israel remains under regular rocket fire from Hezbollah, rendering it unsafe for evacuees to return. Many homes have been damaged or destroyed. Israel\u2019s fight against Hezbollah in Lebanon aims to eliminate this persistent threat to Israeli civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the public mood in Israel amidst the conflict?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> While Israelis are resilient and optimistic, the reality is grim. Families are displaced, loved ones are fighting on the front lines, and civilians face daily rocket threats. Despite this, the hope for peace, the return of hostages, and a safer future remains strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining today\u2019s briefing. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 3 PM Israel time (8 AM EST) with more updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I\u2019m Asher Westropp-Evans. Stay safe.</em></p>\n",
