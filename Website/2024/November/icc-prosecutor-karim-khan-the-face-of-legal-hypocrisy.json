        "rendered": "\n<p>On November 21, 2024, ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan delivered a statement regarding the arrest warrants issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas Commander-in-Chief Mohammed Deif. While cloaked in the language of impartiality and justice, Khan\u2019s remarks are anything but. His statement reflects a deep moral failure of the ICC, equating the actions of Israel\u2014a sovereign state defending its people\u2014with the atrocities of Hamas, a terrorist organization responsible for one of the darkest days in modern history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICC\u2019s decision stems from events surrounding the Hamas-led massacre on October 7, 2023. On that day, <strong>6,000 Palestinians infiltrated Israel</strong>, including <strong>3,800 operatives from Hamas and affiliated terrorist groups</strong> such as those operating within UNRWA. Additionally, <strong>2,200 Gazan civilians participated</strong> in the slaughter. The outcome was devastating:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>1,163 people were murdered,</strong> the majority being Israeli civilians and foreign nationals, including babies, children, women, and the elderly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Among the victims were <strong>301 IDF soldiers, 55 police officers, and 10 Shin Bet personnel</strong> who gave their lives defending their country.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas terrorists conducted unspeakable atrocities\u2014rape, beheadings, burning entire families alive, and slaughtering innocent civilians in their homes. These were deliberate acts of genocide and terror, not military operations. Yet, rather than focusing its attention on these war crimes, the ICC chose to vilify Israel\u2019s leaders for defending their people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khan\u2019s statement highlights the ICC\u2019s indictment of both Mohammed Deif, Hamas\u2019s top commander, and Israeli leaders Netanyahu and Gallant. While Deif faces charges for crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and sexual violence, the inclusion of Netanyahu and Gallant undermines the very notion of justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charges against Israel\u2019s leaders\u2014\u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d and \u201cattacks on civilians\u201d\u2014are baseless and morally indefensible. The Gaza blockade, which Israel implements to limit Hamas\u2019s access to weapons and resources, is a legal and necessary measure under international law. The ICC\u2019s narrative ignores Hamas\u2019s use of civilians as human shields and its exploitation of humanitarian aid for terror purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khan claims to focus on victims \u201cin Israel and Palestine\u201d equally. However, his words ring hollow in light of the ICC\u2019s selective targeting of Israeli leaders while downplaying Hamas\u2019s atrocities. The ICC\u2019s investigation conveniently omits Hamas\u2019s use of human shields, its diversion of humanitarian aid into terror tunnels, and its ongoing campaign to annihilate the Jewish state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Khan feigns impartiality, his priorities betray an inherent bias. The decision to withdraw arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh\u2014citing their deaths\u2014raises serious questions about the ICC\u2019s commitment to accountability. Why did the ICC fail to issue these warrants earlier when these individuals were actively orchestrating Hamas\u2019s terror operations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By equating Israel\u2019s defensive actions with Hamas\u2019s barbarity, the ICC sets a dangerous precedent. This false equivalence rewards terrorism while punishing those who fight to protect civilians. It erases the moral and legal distinction between aggressors and defenders, emboldening groups like Hamas to continue their genocidal campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khan\u2019s statement also reflects the ICC\u2019s disregard for international law\u2019s most basic principles. Israel is a sovereign state with the right\u2014indeed, the obligation\u2014to defend its citizens. By criminalizing these efforts, the ICC effectively endorses Hamas\u2019s strategy of targeting civilians, using hostages, and weaponizing human suffering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICC\u2019s decision is an affront to justice, truth, and the victims of Hamas\u2019s terror. Democracies worldwide must reject this sham process and stand firmly with Israel. Prosecutor Khan\u2019s statement reveals a court that has abandoned its mandate, weaponizing international law to attack the very nations working to uphold it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History will remember October 7 as a day of unspeakable horror\u2014and the ICC\u2019s response as a day of unforgivable betrayal.</h5>\n",
