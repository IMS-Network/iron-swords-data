By relying on casualty figures provided by Hamas-controlled entities and framing legitimate self-defense measures as violations of international law, Khan has lent credibility to terrorist propaganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, his track record includes defending controversial figures accused of mass violence and overlooking crises that have claimed millions of lives in regions like Congo, Syria, and Yemen. Under his leadership, the ICC risks becoming a tool for delegitimizing democracies while offering implicit support to those who perpetuate terrorism and war crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim Ahmad Khan&#8217;s actions send a dangerous message: defending against terrorism is punishable, and terror organizations can exploit international institutions for their benefit. This not only undermines global justice but empowers groups like Hamas to continue their campaigns of violence with impunity.</p>\n",
