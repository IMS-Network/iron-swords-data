The United States, under pressure, convinced Qatar, a major non-NATO ally, to expel Hamas. But now Turkey, a NATO member, is welcoming them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes while Israeli hostages remain in Hamas\u2019s underground terror tunnels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qatar provided Hamas with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Luxury villas,</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nearly $2 billion in funding,</strong> and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Political cover.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is: Should we expect anything different from Turkey?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Comparing Qatar and Turkey\u2019s Responses</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s compare Qatar and Turkey\u2019s actions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>On October 7th,</strong> during Hamas\u2019s massacre, Qatar condemned Israel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Two weeks later,</strong> Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, praised Hamas. He claimed Hamas is not a terror organization but a group of \u201cmujahideen freedom fighters\u201d protecting their land and people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Turkey and Qatar sound the same. Both share support and ideology with Hamas terrorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATO members must reject Turkey&#8217;s actions\u2014welcoming, funding, or supporting Hamas. Instead, NATO must demand the immediate extradition of Hamas leaders so they can face justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 1: Assassination Plot Against Irwin Cotler</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> There\u2019s breaking news that Canadian authorities foiled an Iranian attempt to assassinate Irwin Cotler. What are your thoughts on this and Iran\u2019s global targeting of Israelis and Jews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Irwin Cotler is a prominent human rights advocate, not just for Jews and Israelis, but globally. Iran targeting him is not surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Suppresses its people, using terror to maintain control,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Denies basic human rights, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Operates under a theocratic regime that mocks the concept of democracy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This assassination attempt should alarm the world. If Iran targets a defender of global human rights, who else will it target? This underscores the need for a global effort to shut down Iran\u2019s terror activities, nuclear ambitions, and oppressive regime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 2: Diplomatic Pressure on Turkey</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What diplomatic pressure should be placed on Turkey, especially as it advertises itself as a tourist destination?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Turkey under Erdo\u011fan has shifted from being a tourism-friendly state to a quasi-sponsor of terror. As a NATO member, Turkey has obligations to uphold Western values and reject terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All NATO countries must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hold Turkey accountable</strong> for housing and supporting Hamas terrorists, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make it clear that continued support for Hamas will jeopardize its standing in NATO and relationships with the West.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If Turkey chooses to host Hamas leaders who could release Israeli hostages but refuse, it aligns itself with terrorism, not democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 3: The International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Incoming Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune threatened U.S. sanctions on the ICC if it issues arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu. What are your thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The ICC\u2019s consideration of targeting Israeli leaders is absurd. While the world faces terror regimes, genocides, and oppressive governments, the ICC is singling out the leaders of Israel\u2014a democratic nation fighting terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This highlights the ICC&#8217;s failure to deliver justice. Any country that respects itself and democracy should reconsider funding the ICC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for U.S.-Israel relations, this is a partnership of shared values, where both nations stand united against terror and for freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 4: IDF Operations in Lebanon</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> The IDF reported finding dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers in Lebanon. How difficult is it to locate these launchers, and how many more might there be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a war zone. Here\u2019s what the IDF faces:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rocket launchers hidden under olive orchards,</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kalashnikovs, RPGs, and grenades stored in nearly every home, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An underground terror infrastructure beneath civilian areas.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliminating this threat requires painstaking operations, risking the lives of Israeli soldiers. Israel\u2019s goal is to ensure safety for the 60,000 Israelis displaced by Hezbollah\u2019s rockets and millions more under threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 5: Qatar\u2019s Decision to Expel Hamas</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did Qatar expel Hamas terrorists now, after hosting them for over a decade?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> While the specifics of the decision remain unclear, timing suggests it followed the U.S. election. Pressure from either the current Biden administration or the incoming Trump administration likely forced Qatar\u2019s hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qatar has long played both sides\u2014housing U.S. military bases while funding terrorist organizations. This decision is a positive step but insufficient. Qatar must cease all terror support and align itself with democratic, human rights-respecting nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining us at the Israeli Citizen Spokesperson\u2019s Office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are live daily at 3 PM Israel time, 8 AM Eastern Standard Time.
