        "rendered": "\n<p>In protests supporting Hamas or in discussions surrounding the Israeli-Iran conflict, one often hears the chant, <em>&#8220;Long live the resistance.&#8221;</em> At first glance, this phrase might seem innocuous, even inspiring to some. But when examined closely, it becomes clear that this is far more than a rallying cry\u2014it is a thinly veiled endorsement of terrorism, bloodshed, and the annihilation of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chant isn\u2019t confined to protests. It echoes in classrooms, rallies, and online spaces, reflecting the ideology of those who advocate for the so-called &#8220;resistance.&#8221; To them, this &#8220;resistance&#8221; doesn\u2019t mean peaceful protest or a desire for coexistence. It means supporting violent organizations like Hamas, celebrating attacks like the October 7th massacre, and calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. <br>This isn\u2019t speculation\u2014they shout it outright. Phrases like <em>&#8220;Long Live the Resistance&#8221;</em> make it crystal clear: the end goal is the total eradication of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Call for More Terror</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The October 7th massacre, in which Hamas slaughtered over 1,400 people, including children, women, and the elderly, was one of the most heinous acts of terrorism in recent history. To anyone chanting &#8220;Long live the resistance,&#8221; this massacre wasn\u2019t a tragedy\u2014it was a triumph. The chant is a euphemism for endorsing exactly this kind of barbarity. When someone says it, they are implicitly, if not explicitly, advocating for further violence, more bloodshed, and the continuation of a campaign that seeks to wipe Israel off the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Ambiguity in Their Intentions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The goals of Hamas and its supporters are not hidden\u2014they are stated plainly. The nonexistent &#8220;state of Palestine&#8221; that these individuals champion is a euphemism for the complete destruction of Israel. They reject peace, refuse to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, and glorify terrorism. The chant &#8220;Long live the resistance&#8221; serves as a hate slogan, a rallying cry for the annihilation of a nation and its people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not about &#8220;resistance&#8221; in the sense of standing against oppression or injustice. This is about supporting terrorism, plain and simple. The phrase &#8220;resistance&#8221; is a rhetorical smokescreen, designed to mask the barbarity of groups like Hamas while enabling their sympathizers to avoid accountability.</p>\n",
