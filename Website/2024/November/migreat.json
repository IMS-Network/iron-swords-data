Their recent posts expose their dangerous rhetoric and antisemitic agenda, painting Jewish civilians as &#8220;genocide committers&#8221; and invoking the term &#8220;intifada&#8221;\u2014a call that historically has been associated with violent uprisings and terror attacks targeting Jews. By using inflammatory language like &#8220;Globalize the intifada,&#8221; Migreat is not merely expressing a political stance; it is actively encouraging a campaign of terror and violence against Jewish communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post from Bijlmer Arena, Migreat expresses outrage over a football match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv, dehumanizing Israeli athletes and by extension the Jewish community, labeling them with inflammatory slurs. This kind of rhetoric isn\u2019t just hateful; it\u2019s a calculated attempt to rally followers toward viewing Jewish civilians as legitimate targets for aggression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is not activism. This is a dangerous promotion of violence.</strong> By advocating for the &#8220;globalization of the intifada&#8221; and using hashtags that glorify aggression, Migreat has positioned itself as a sympathizer with terror and an instigator of hatred. The use of profanity and dehumanizing language makes it clear that Migreat\u2019s purpose is not peace or justice, but to foster an environment of fear, hostility, and violence against Jews in Amsterdam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Migreat\u2019s words and actions must be recognized for what they are: a threat to public safety and a blatant endorsement of terrorism. Supporting or associating with Migreat means aligning oneself with an organization that glorifies hatred and violence. They have crossed the line from protest to dangerous incitement, and their activities should be condemned by all who stand against terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let it be clear: Migreat does not stand for peace\u2014it stands with terror.</strong> Their followers and supporters should be fully aware that supporting Migreat is tantamount to endorsing antisemitic violence and terror on the streets of Amsterdam.</p>\n",
