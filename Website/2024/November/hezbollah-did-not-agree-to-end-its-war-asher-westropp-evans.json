US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Lebanon for ceasefire talks, and some Lebanese politicians are reportedly expressing willingness for a ceasefire\u2014albeit with added conditions. However, <strong>Lebanese politicians are not the ones waging war on Israel</strong>, nor are they in a position to make binding agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality remains: <strong>Iran\u2019s terror proxy, Hezbollah, is responsible for the ongoing attacks on Israel, and there is no confirmation that Hezbollah has agreed to a ceasefire.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hezbollah&#8217;s War Since October 8th</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On <strong>October 8, 2023</strong>, Hezbollah joined Hamas in attacking Israel. Since then:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>16,000 Iranian rockets, missiles, and drones</strong> have been launched from Lebanon at Israel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hezbollah operates with <strong>200,000 Iranian bombs</strong> aimed at Israeli civilian areas.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Iranian weapons continue to be smuggled from Syria into Lebanon to sustain Hezbollah\u2019s operations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Status Quo Before October 8th</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the escalation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>UN Security Council Resolution 1701</strong>, intended to prevent Hezbollah\u2019s militarization, was not enforced.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hezbollah entrenched itself near Israel\u2019s border, even alongside <strong>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon)</strong> positions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning to this pre-war &#8220;normal&#8221; is unacceptable. Any ceasefire must:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Remove Hezbollah\u2019s Iranian-provided rockets</strong>,</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dismantle Hezbollah\u2019s terror infrastructure</strong>, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prevent future smuggling of Iranian weapons through Syria into Lebanon.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hezbollah\u2019s Current Position</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah is under:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Military pressure</strong> from Israeli operations,</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Economic strain</strong>, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Political scrutiny</strong> within Lebanon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now is the time to ensure Hezbollah cannot rearm, regroup, or rebuild its ability to threaten Israel. Any agreement must exceed the failed conditions of <strong>Resolution 1701</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aid in Gaza and Hamas\u2019 Exploitation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in Gaza, <strong>Hamas continues to exploit humanitarian aid</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>109 aid trucks</strong> entering Gaza were violently looted.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>99 trucks</strong> were stolen by Hamas militants, forcing drivers to unload supplies at gunpoint.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hamas reportedly earns over <strong>$500 million by reselling stolen aid</strong> to Gazans on the black market.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel, working with organizations like the <strong>World Food Programme</strong>, is committed to ensuring aid reaches civilians while avoiding theft by Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 1: Was mainstream media lying about Hezbollah?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Media reports suggesting that Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire are misleading. While Lebanese politicians or Hezbollah may propose conditional agreements, these claims lack official confirmation and do not constitute a genuine ceasefire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 2: Why doesn\u2019t the IDF bomb Iran directly?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Israel\u2019s goal is not outright war with Iran but ensuring its security and stability. While Iran funds and orchestrates attacks via proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel\u2019s focus remains on countering immediate threats and preventing escalation into full-scale regional conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 3: Are Lebanese politicians emboldened to oppose Hezbollah?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> While Hezbollah\u2019s influence in Lebanon is immense, its recent losses may embolden some Lebanese figures. However, Hezbollah remains deeply entrenched politically and militarily, making open opposition risky. A sustainable solution requires dismantling Hezbollah\u2019s control over Lebanon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 4: What does Hamas\u2019 move to Turkey mean for negotiations?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Turkey has long provided shelter to Hamas leaders, with President Erdo\u011fan adopting a pro-Hamas stance. Increased pressure from democratic nations is needed to hold Turkey accountable for enabling Hamas operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in to today\u2019s update from the <strong>Israeli Citizen Spokesperson\u2019s Office</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are live daily at <strong>3 PM Israel time (8 AM EST)</strong> to keep you informed. Remember, the truth matters\u2014spread it, share it, and support Israel in its fight for security and peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Asher Westropp-Evans</strong></p>\n",
