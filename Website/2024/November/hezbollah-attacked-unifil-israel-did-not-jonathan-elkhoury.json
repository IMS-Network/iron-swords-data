Italy\u2019s Defense Minister initially blamed Israel. However, after an Israeli investigation revealed that <strong>Hezbollah</strong> was responsible, Italy now agrees with Israel&#8217;s findings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This attack is not an isolated incident:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Three attacks on UNIFIL</strong> by Hezbollah occurred just yesterday, targeting multiple UNIFIL bases and injuring <strong>at least four soldiers.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Despite these clear attacks, UNIFIL only referred to the perpetrators as \u201cnon-state actors.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNIFIL&#8217;s Challenges</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>UNIFIL repeatedly fails to hold Hezbollah accountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>UNIFIL does not acknowledge Hezbollah&#8217;s armed presence or tunneling activity near their bases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UNIFIL\u2019s reluctance may stem from fear of <strong>Hezbollah retaliation</strong> or <strong>corruption via bribes</strong>, as previously reported.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UNIFIL\u2019s inability to enforce peace undermines their credibility</strong> and any potential future agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Israel\u2019s Conditions for Peace</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>US envoy Amos Hochstein is mediating ceasefire talks, but <strong>Israel\u2019s position is firm</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hezbollah\u2019s <strong>terror infrastructure must be dismantled</strong> across Lebanon, not just near the border.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Western forces must enforce what UNIFIL failed to achieve\u2014preventing Hezbollah\u2019s rearmament.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Israel must retain <strong>freedom to act militarily</strong> if Hezbollah violates the agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning to the status quo of <strong>October 8, 2023</strong>, before the escalation, is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>On that date, Hezbollah had <strong>200,000 Iranian-provided rockets</strong> aimed at Israel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hezbollah freely smuggled Iranian weapons through Syria.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Israel is fighting to ensure Hezbollah cannot regroup and threaten its citizens.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q&amp;A Session</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 1: Is a Lebanon ceasefire likely?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> While US envoy Amos Hochstein continues talks with Lebanese officials, including Hezbollah representatives, meaningful progress requires genuine commitments. <strong>Israel demands that Hezbollah cannot rearm or regroup.</strong> If Lebanon\u2019s government and Hezbollah agree to these terms, a ceasefire may be achievable. However, <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s history suggests distrust in their intentions.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 2: What happened to Lebanese academic Charles Chartouni?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Charles Chartouni, a prominent Lebanese academic who denounced Hezbollah and advocated for peace with Israel, reportedly faces <strong>arrest or persecution.</strong> This aligns with broader trends in Lebanon, where Hezbollah targets individuals opposing their influence. Lebanese voices calling for peace often face retaliation, illustrating <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s stranglehold</strong> over Lebanon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 3: How are regular Lebanese citizens affected?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Ordinary Lebanese citizens are victims of <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s control</strong> and Iran\u2019s influence. Many long for liberation from Hezbollah\u2019s dominance, which threatens not only Israel but also Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. These citizens remain hopeful for a future free of Hezbollah, but fear <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s potential retaliation</strong> against dissent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 4: Does UNIFIL have a future in Lebanon?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> UNIFIL has failed in its mandate to disarm Hezbollah and prevent its militarization in southern Lebanon. For 18 years, UNIFIL watched Hezbollah grow stronger, build tunnels, and smuggle weapons near its bases. <strong>Israel insists on international forces that can enforce compliance</strong> with peace terms\u2014a role UNIFIL has not fulfilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Question 5: Can the $5 million hostage reward make a difference?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Israel\u2019s offer of <strong>$5 million per hostage</strong> could incentivize Gaza civilians or non-Hamas actors holding hostages to cooperate. <strong>101 hostages remain in Gaza</strong>, and Israel is determined to bring them home. The reward may encourage those in Gaza to act against Hamas and return hostages safely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UNIFIL\u2019s failures and Hezbollah\u2019s unchecked aggression underline the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms.</strong> Israel is fighting to ensure the safety of its citizens while supporting Lebanese hopes for a Hezbollah-free future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us tomorrow at <strong>3 PM Israel time / 8 AM EST</strong> for the latest updates.</p>\n",
