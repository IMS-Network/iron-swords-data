        "rendered": "\n<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC), entrusted with upholding justice, has chosen instead to undermine it. By issuing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the ICC has delivered a dangerous and immoral verdict: the October 7 massacre, orchestrated by Hamas, is acceptable under international law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This disgraceful action by the ICC, which equates Israel\u2019s defensive measures with Hamas\u2019s unprovoked barbarity, sends a clear message. Defending innocent lives is a punishable offense, while committing atrocities earns a slap on the wrist\u2014or worse, tacit validation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, approximately 6,000 Hamas operatives launched an unprovoked, coordinated attack on Israel, crossing into its territory to commit unimaginable acts of violence. This included approximately 3,800 Palestinian terrorists and 2,200 Gazan collaborators, including those disguised as civilians, who played logistical and support roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results were horrific: <strong>1,163 people were murdered</strong>, the overwhelming majority of them Israeli citizens and foreign nationals, including babies, children, women, and the elderly. Among the victims were <strong>301 Israeli soldiers, 55 police officers, and 10 Shin Bet personnel</strong> who died defending their country. Thousands more were injured, and over 200 individuals\u2014including women, children, and the elderly\u2014were taken hostage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas\u2019s atrocities included mass shootings, beheadings, rape, and the burning alive of entire families. The group\u2019s intention was not merely to instill fear but to enact genocide\u2014a deliberate campaign to kill Jews and eradicate the State of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of condemning Hamas\u2019s actions unequivocally, the ICC chose to target Israel\u2019s leaders for defending their citizens. Netanyahu and Gallant stand accused of \u201cwar crimes\u201d for enforcing a blockade on Gaza, a security measure aimed at neutralizing Hamas\u2019s terror capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This accusation disregards the role of Hamas in creating and perpetuating Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis. Hamas has consistently diverted resources meant for civilian use to build rockets, tunnels, and weapons, while embedding its operations in hospitals, schools, and residential areas. The ICC\u2019s narrative blames Israel for the suffering in Gaza while excusing Hamas\u2019s deliberate use of its population as human shields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the ICC included Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in its warrants, this is nothing more than window dressing. Deif, the architect of the October 7 massacre, is responsible for the murders of over 1,100 people and countless acts of terror. Yet the ICC\u2019s focus remains disproportionately on Israel, the only democracy in the region, which is acting to protect its citizens from an existential threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This moral equivalence between a democratic nation defending itself and a terrorist organization committing genocide is an outrageous betrayal of international law and justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By targeting Israel while offering only token accountability for Hamas, the ICC has set a horrifying precedent. It has erased the distinction between aggressors and defenders, between terrorists and those protecting their people. The court\u2019s actions send a message to the world:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you massacre civilians, you\u2019ll face symbolic scrutiny.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you defend civilians, you\u2019ll face prosecution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This inversion of justice doesn\u2019t just endanger Israel; it emboldens terrorists worldwide. It rewards the use of human shields, hostage-taking, and mass murder, signaling that the international community will hold defenders more accountable than perpetrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The ICC\u2019s True Agenda</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICC\u2019s actions are not about justice; they are about politics. By treating \u201cPalestine\u201d as a legitimate state and prosecuting Israeli leaders, the ICC is advancing an agenda to delegitimize Israel\u2019s existence. This move aligns with the narratives of those who seek to dismantle Israel as a sovereign state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court\u2019s selective outrage is glaring. Where are the arrest warrants for the leaders of Iran, the primary backers of Hamas\u2019s terror infrastructure? Where is the accountability for Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons or China\u2019s genocide of Uyghurs? The ICC has chosen to single out Israel while ignoring far more egregious crimes.</p>\n",
