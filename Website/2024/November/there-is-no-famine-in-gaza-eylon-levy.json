Aid is not restricted, and the flow of supplies into Gaza has been robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, <strong>700 trucks of aid are uncollected</strong> by the UN inside Gaza. The <strong>IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification)</strong>, which monitors food security, acknowledges that no famine has occurred in Gaza despite their warnings of one in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famine, by IPC\u2019s definition, involves <strong>3,000 to 6,000 hunger-related deaths per week</strong>. Not even Hamas has made claims remotely resembling this threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aid Distribution in Gaza</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel has facilitated more aid to Gaza post-October 7th than ever before. Notable figures include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>3,457 truckloads of aid</strong> in September, exceeding pre-war levels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two crossings in Northern Gaza capable of handling <strong>600 trucks weekly</strong>, nearly double the pre-war intake.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ongoing efforts by Israel to repair roads, extend crossing hours, and coordinate humanitarian pauses for aid delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these efforts, <strong>hundreds of trucks remain uncollected daily</strong>, due to logistical failures on the Gazan side and <strong>Hamas\u2019 hijacking of supplies</strong>, which are sold on the black market to fund its war machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Role of Qatar</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports suggest that Qatar has asked Hamas leaders to leave, though this remains unconfirmed. Israel has long criticized Qatar\u2019s role, labeling it as <strong>Hamas\u2019 agent</strong> rather than a neutral mediator. Qatar\u2019s continued hosting of Hamas leaders undermines peace efforts, and any meaningful resolution would require Qatar to extradite these leaders to face justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is preventing more humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Israel has opened channels for aid delivery, including land, air, and sea routes. However, Hamas hijacks and exploits this aid, diverting it from civilians to sustain its fighters and fund its operations. Ensuring aid reaches civilians requires international organizations to bypass Hamas-controlled intermediaries and hold Hamas accountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What pressure can be applied to Qatar to release the hostages?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Qatar should no longer be treated as a normal state. Diplomatic measures such as sanctions, leveraging international summits, and public condemnation are necessary. Countries like Qatar, Iran, and Turkey must be pressured to compel Hamas to release all hostages and cease using them as bargaining chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are your thoughts on the attack on Israeli fans in Amsterdam?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> The premeditated attack on Israelis in Amsterdam is a manifestation of globalized anti-Semitism fueled by extremist rhetoric. Incidents like this highlight the danger of movements calling to \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d and the need to combat such ideologies, which target Jews and Israelis worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How was your speaking tour in Canada?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Canada faces a growing problem of domestic extremism, as evidenced by alarming incidents during the tour. Protesters blocked event doors and shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d in Calgary, while masked mobs camped outside a synagogue in Montreal, violating a court order. These acts of intimidation reflect a broader threat to both Jewish safety and Canada\u2019s liberal democratic values.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing Statement</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 3 PM Israel time (8 AM EST) with updates. Stay safe.</p>\n",
