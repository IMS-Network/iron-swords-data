        "rendered": "\n<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has become a sham of its original mission, thanks to its current prosecutor, <strong>Karim Ahmad Khan</strong>. Under Khan\u2019s watch, the ICC has abandoned justice and accountability to become a political tool for enabling terror. Instead of targeting mass murderers and genocidal regimes, Khan has made it his personal mission to go after Israel\u2014a democracy fighting for its survival against terrorists like Hamas. Who is Karim Ahmad Khan, and why is his leadership such a disgrace? Let\u2019s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man leading the ICC is a figure surrounded by scandal and questions of integrity. <strong>Karim Ahmad Khan</strong> is not an impartial enforcer of justice; he\u2019s a man whose actions and associations scream <strong>bias</strong>, <strong>failure</strong>, and <strong>collusion with terrorists</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. His Religious Bias Is Clear</strong><br>Khan, a Pakistani Muslim from the UK, reportedly quotes the Quran in all his public speeches. Let\u2019s be real\u2014justice doesn\u2019t need religious sermons. The ICC is supposed to enforce international law, not allow a prosecutor\u2019s personal faith to dictate the agenda. Yet Khan makes no attempt to hide his priorities, and those priorities clearly do not include the safety or survival of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Family of Scandals</strong><br>Khan\u2019s brother is a convicted sex offender, and while that\u2019s not directly tied to Karim, it raises the question: is this a family that can be trusted with something as serious as international justice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Sexual Misconduct Allegations</strong><br>If you thought his family history was bad, Karim himself has faced <strong>allegations of sexual misconduct</strong>. How does a man accused of such behavior get to sit at the top of an institution meant to uphold justice? Where\u2019s the accountability?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Career Built on Defending War Criminals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before assuming his position as the chief prosecutor of the ICC, Karim Ahmad Khan\u2019s career was defined by his controversial choice of clients and the morally questionable cases he chose to defend. While every individual has a legal right to representation, Khan\u2019s decision to act as defense counsel for some of the most notorious figures accused of heinous crimes against humanity raises serious concerns about his commitment to the principles of justice and accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most infamous cases in Khan\u2019s legal career was his defense of <strong>William Ruto</strong>, the Vice President of Kenya, who was accused of orchestrating mass violence following the country\u2019s 2007\u20132008 elections. The violence, which erupted along ethnic lines, resulted in the deaths of <strong>1,200 people</strong> and the displacement of over <strong>600,000 individuals</strong>, leaving entire communities in ruins. Ruto was charged with <strong>crimes against humanity</strong>, including <strong>murder, persecution, and the forcible transfer of populations</strong>\u2014charges that strike at the core of the ICC\u2019s mandate to address the gravest violations of international law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In court, Khan worked aggressively to discredit witnesses and question the credibility of evidence, a tactic that ultimately led to the collapse of the case due to allegations of witness tampering and intimidation. Critics argue that the trial\u2019s failure was less a matter of Ruto\u2019s innocence and more a reflection of the systemic interference that made it impossible for justice to prevail. The collapse of the case not only denied closure to the victims of Kenya\u2019s post-election violence but also raised questions about Khan\u2019s methods and the lengths he was willing to go to defend his client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is true that lawyers are bound to represent their clients to the best of their ability, there is a stark difference between upholding the legal system and actively participating in undermining justice. Ruto\u2019s case was not an isolated instance. Over the years, Khan has built a reputation for defending high-profile individuals accused of grave crimes, many of whom were implicated in mass killings, ethnic cleansing, and systemic oppression. This pattern of representation begs the question: How does a man who has spent much of his career defending alleged war criminals suddenly position himself as the world\u2019s leading enforcer of justice at the ICC?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conflict of interest becomes even more glaring when considering the selectivity with which Khan, as ICC prosecutor, now pursues cases. His tenure has been marked by a disproportionate focus on Israel\u2014accusing its leaders of \u201cwar crimes\u201d while ignoring the atrocities committed by authoritarian regimes and terror groups worldwide. This selective application of justice stands in stark contrast to the principles the ICC was founded upon and raises concerns about whether Khan\u2019s actions are guided by justice or political motivations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, his work defending individuals accused of atrocities against humanity has led many to question his ability to empathize with victims of such crimes. How does someone who built a career representing individuals accused of organizing mass murder reconcile that history with the responsibility of seeking justice for those very same victims? The answer, for many, is that Khan\u2019s tenure at the ICC has been less about justice and more about pursuing a personal and political agenda that undermines the court\u2019s credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far from being a neutral figure in the pursuit of accountability, Karim Ahmad Khan\u2019s career trajectory reveals a troubling inconsistency: a man who once stood alongside alleged perpetrators of violence now claims to act as the voice for their victims. The result is a crisis of confidence in the ICC\u2019s ability to fulfill its mandate under his leadership. Instead of restoring faith in international justice, Khan has only deepened doubts about the court\u2019s impartiality and effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of William Ruto, Khan\u2019s legal defense may have helped his client evade accountability, but it left a scar on Kenya\u2019s justice system and denied the victims of post-election violence the closure they deserved. This episode\u2014and others like it\u2014raise a fundamental question: Can a man who has repeatedly prioritized the interests of the powerful over the rights of the powerless truly lead an institution tasked with upholding justice on behalf of the world\u2019s most vulnerable? So far, Khan\u2019s record at the ICC offers little reason for optimism.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The ICC/un Has No Credibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Khan\u2019s selective prosecutions and reliance on Hamas propaganda reveal his true colors. By targeting Israel while ignoring mass atrocities worldwide, he has shown himself to be a <strong>terrorist enabler</strong> who uses the ICC to legitimize Hamas\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even his appointment reeks of bias. Khan was backed by <strong>UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres</strong>, another figure notorious for his anti-Israel stance. Together, they\u2019ve turned the ICC into a weapon for demonizing Israel rather than upholding justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Karim Ahmad Khan, the ICC has become a farce. Its focus on Israel is not about justice\u2014it\u2019s about politics, propaganda, and enabling terrorism. By targeting a democracy defending itself against genocidal threats, the ICC has betrayed its mission and become complicit in Hamas\u2019s war crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world must reject this disgraceful institution and call out Karim Ahmad Khan for what he is: a biased, incompetent prosecutor who has turned the ICC into a tool for terror. Justice demands better. The victims of Hamas\u2019s atrocities deserve better. And Israel, like every nation, has the right to defend itself without fear of persecution from a corrupt international body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICC under Khan? <strong>A disgrace to humanity.</strong></p>\n",
