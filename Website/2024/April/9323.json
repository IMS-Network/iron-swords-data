We will complete the investigation in the coming days, learn from the conclusions, and implement them immediately.<br />\nWe will share, with full transparency, the findings of the investigation with the World Central Kitchen and additional international bodies.<br />\nWe see great importance in the continuation of humanitarian aid and will continue to help in this vital effort.</p>\n",
