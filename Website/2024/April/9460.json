We prepared for the &#8216;Iron Dome&#8217; operation, this preparation brought Iran to also face the aerial superiority that you expressed very well.<br />\nWe saw last Monday what was being organized, and we think that Israel is very strong and knows how to cope alone, but with such a massive and distant threat we are always glad to have with us, and I tell you, a call to the American Central Command, General Corilla, on Monday, by Thursday morning he had already landed in the country, we began joint coordination. There is something in this statement &#8211; Iran meets here a very, very strong international capability.<br />\nYou see that we look forward, we weigh our steps, and this launching of so many missiles, cruise missiles, Katyushas at Israel will be answered.<br />\nWe conclude this visit, excellent people conduct excellent processes and achieve excellent results. It is very, very noticeable. I think you&#8217;re well prepared and I trust this capability very much for what will be required.&#8221;</p>\n",
