It&#8217;s the best choice someone your age can make in the state of Israel in 2024 and we would like more people from all parts of Israeli society to experience this pride of enlisting in the IDF, and to experience this encounter, a duty that is a great privilege to defend the country and to be together, different people for the same purpose. A very ethical mission, truly noble to return our citizens who were kidnapped into the Gaza Strip home. To fight in the IDF, to fight to create conditions for returning kidnapped people of ours, citizens who were seized into enemy territory is a lofty mission, a mission that each of us is ready to risk his life for and prepared to do anything to succeed in it.<br />\nLooking at you is also a very, very great Israeli pride. So I wish you on behalf of the entire IDF, and on behalf of the state of Israel that you have a successful enlistment, do well in defending the state of Israel &#8211; good luck&#8221;.</p>\n",
