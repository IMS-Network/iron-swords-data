        "rendered": "<p>IDF Spokesperson:</p>\n<p>For the first time after 50 years; 74 reservists have completed the combat officers&#8217; course in the Ground Forces </p>\n<p>The combat officers&#8217; course in the Ground Forces ended today (Thursday) in a ceremony held at the Officers&#8217; School (Bahad 1) at &#8220;Laskov&#8221; camp, at Mitzpe Ramon. The ceremony was held under the command of the Commander of the Ground Forces, Major General Tamir Yadai, Commander of the Training and Exercise Command, Major General David Zini, and the families of the course graduates.</p>\n<p>The officers&#8217; course in the Ground Forces is a unique course, including seven weeks of training held against the backdrop of war. The fighters were recruited under Order 8, and after five months of combat across all sectors, they chose to take the combat officers&#8217; course in the reserves.<br />\nDuring their training in the &#8220;Dolav&#8221; battalion, the reservists conducted joint exercises with engineering and armor forces, gained experience as division commanders in combat in the Gaza Strip, and acquired the tactical knowledge required for a combat officer.</p>\n<p>The 74 graduating officers join the IDF&#8217;s command line and are set to integrate into senior roles in the fighting reserve units, to command across all sectors and to lead the IDF in combat.</p>\n<p>From the words of the Commander of the Ground Forces, Major General Tamir Yadai: &#8220;Today I ask to applaud and thank this family, the reservist family, which stood with us in great matters, a steadfast family, a recruited family, a protective family, a capturing family, a good family. One moment in holiday clothes and another moment on the battlefield, one moment in a career and another moment in war. One moment of family life and another moment in the army. I am full of appreciation for your choice to recognize the strength of your leadership, to go to officerhood in the midst of life, from a mature place and with immense sacrifice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From the words of the Commander of the Officers\u2019 School, Brigadier General Yehuda Vach: &#8220;In a few more days we will celebrate the Passover holiday, a holiday in the shadow of war. We will tell about the bravery of the fighters, about their readiness to fight for the land, we will tell about the people&#8217;s readiness to fight for its land, but above all, we will tell about the bravery of the reserve fighters who have been fighting for more than half a year in all the war zones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Attached is documentation of the &#8220;Dolav&#8221; battalion&#8217;s activity during the training:<br />\nhttps://bit.ly/3JoQZNe</p>\n<p>Attached are pictures from the course graduation ceremony:<br />\nhttps://idfanc.activetrail.biz/ANC18042684</p>\n",
