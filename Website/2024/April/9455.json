Last evening and during nighttime hours, we assessed the situation regarding restrictions. Approaching midnight, understanding was reached and the decision was made to lift the restrictions, out of a desire to alleviate the defensive policy, while maintaining security. The opening of businesses and the return of parents to work were decided upon, and at midnight we decided to remove restrictions on education and gatherings.<br />\nI am aware of the difficulty of the heads of local and regional councils to organize during the nighttime hours, so the return to normality was gradual.<br />\nWe are in a long war, changes can occur even in the coming days due to the situation assessment.<br />\nIn conclusion, I want to note the meticulous adherence of the residents of the State of Israel to the instructions. Continue to listen and act according to the instructions of the Home Front Command, they save lives.&#8221;</p>\n",
