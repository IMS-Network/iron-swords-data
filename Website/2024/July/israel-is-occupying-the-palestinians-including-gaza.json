        "rendered": "\n<p>From 2005 to October 2023, Israel was not occupying any part of Gaza. In 2005, Israel implemented a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, leaving no civilians or military personnel behind. This disengagement was part of an effort to advance peace in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the withdrawal, control over Gaza was handed to the Palestinian Authority. However, after the 2006 Palestinian elections and a violent coup by Hamas in 2007, Hamas took over governance of Gaza. Since then, Hamas has ruled the strip, shaping its political and social landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Role of Hamas and the Blockade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaza shares its borders with both Israel and Egypt. The blockade enforced by these countries is often misunderstood. It is a legal, defensive measure necessitated by Hamas&#8217; declared intentions, threats, and acts of violence. This blockade is not an occupation but a security response to prevent further escalation of violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A Timeline Since Israel Withdrew from Gaza\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwBeRnqtiBk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",
