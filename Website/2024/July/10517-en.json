From this platform, I want to say clearly \u2013 the Air Force entered the events of that cursed Saturday without any operational readiness issues. We took off for this difficult multi-front war united, despite the protests, and since then we have not landed. We will not land until the mission is completed, until we defeat all our enemies. In the coming weeks, we will complete the unit&#8217;s inquiry, present it internally within the IDF, and then present it to the public with transparency. Last week, the inquiry into the events in the settlement of Bari was presented to the public. As their commander, I have given and will continue to give support for the decisions made in the field on the morning of October 7. A culture of inquiry is deeply rooted in the DNA of the Air Force. This is how we become better, more worthy to the citizens we have sworn to protect.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Attached is a video of the words of the Air Force Commander, Major General Tomer Bar: https://bit.ly/3WtzRft</p>\n",
