The effort now, and the reason we are working here week after week, is the effort to destroy the infrastructure\u2014both above ground and underground\u2014and that takes time. Therefore, this campaign is long because we do not want to leave Rafiah with its infrastructure intact. There are people we have killed underground; there are people who tried to escape, and we killed them. </p>\n<p>This ongoing effort of ours, this pursuit, is very, very important. They should feel exhausted, and we will feel charged and determined. When we move to the next phase, we will adapt the appropriate measures to this stage, bring other methods, bring a different strategy, and provide logistical support in a way that fits this stage. All of these things ultimately converge into our determination, perseverance, and patience, turning it into exhaustion for the other side and realization of our tasks. A lot of will, a lot of patience, and persistence; the results will speak for themselves later. </p>\n<p>Much respect, thank you.&#8221;</p>\n",
