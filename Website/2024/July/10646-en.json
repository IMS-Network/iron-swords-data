We were near these bodies in the past but did not know how to reach out. Now we only knew how to reach out, and we reached out. We brought back five remains, which you may not have believed we\u2019d ever be able to do. We really want to bring back hostages alive, and that requires pressure, killing Hamas commanders, killing Hamas operatives. The agreement for the release of hostages is something we are pushing to achieve and to bring under good conditions, and this is a top priority. This is a defined war goal, and we don\u2019t need anyone to define it for us. This is a basic value issue. And we will not let up on Hamas until we return the hostages. And we will not let up on Hamas until we dismantle the last battalion, the last company, and we are working very hard. We are constantly thinking about how to push forward.\u201d</p>\n",
