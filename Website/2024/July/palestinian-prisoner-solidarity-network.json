This sham organization has been <strong>funneling money and resources to Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</strong>, both of which are notorious for targeting innocent Israeli civilians in their brutal terrorist campaigns.

These groups work together to <strong>raise funds, organize events, and generate propaganda</strong>\u2014all aimed at furthering the cause of terrorism. Whether through fundraising campaigns, protests, or conferences, Samidoun and its allies channel money and resources into the hands of organizations that are responsible for <strong>the slaughter of civilians</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These funds, masked as \u201chumanitarian aid,\u201d have flowed directly into Hamas&#8217; coffers, enabling the <strong>October 7th massacre</strong>, in which Hamas terrorists executed over 1,400 Israelis in cold blood, including children, women, and the elderly. <strong>Samidoun\u2019s role in this network makes them complicit in these heinous acts</strong>, acting as a bridge between global fundraising efforts and the violent militias that carry out terror against Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samidoun\u2019s network of allied &#8220;pro-Palestinian&#8221; groups exists to sustain terrorism. These organizations, under the guise of solidarity or prisoner rights, <strong>actively fund the killing of Israeli civilians</strong>. Anyone who supports Samidoun or these aligned groups is supporting a machine of terror\u2014one that uses humanitarian narratives to fund bombings, kidnappings, and massacres. Samidoun is a vital cog in the machinery of terrorism, fueling the operations of both Hamas and the PFLP, ensuring that more innocent lives are lost in their violent campaigns.</p>\n",
