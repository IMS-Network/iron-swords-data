Mohsen is the highest-ranking military figure in Hezbollah, and he is also a very close person to Nasrallah; he basically organizes all the military matters for him. This man is responsible for all the orders given, for the 12 children who were killed on Saturday afternoon in Majdal Shams, and for the operation we had yesterday in Gush Halav, in the afternoon hours. We have confidence in our planned moves forward because our intention regarding Hezbollah is not to return to October 6. Mohsen will not be around, but we are also not willing to let the situation return to a presence on the border, to 200 meters from Metula, or from Shlomi, or from Rosh Hanikra. The IDF knows how to operate and reach certain windows in neighborhoods in Beirut, it can also attack at specific points underground, and we also know how to conduct strong internal maneuvers. You are training on this this week, and this ability is very important.&#8221;</p>\n",
