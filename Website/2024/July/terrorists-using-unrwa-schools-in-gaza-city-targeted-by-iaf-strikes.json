        "rendered": "\n<p>In an ongoing effort to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) conducted targeted strikes earlier today on operatives of the Hamas terrorist organization who were using UNRWA schools as operational bases. The strikes targeted the &#8220;Alqahirah&#8221; School in Al-Furqan and the &#8220;Musa&#8221; School in Daraj Tuffah. These facilities were not only serving as shelters for terrorists but were also actively used as hubs for planning, directing, and executing attacks against IDF troops engaged in operations in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA Facilities: Cover for Terrorist Operations</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of UNRWA schools as operational infrastructure for Hamas reveals a deep level of entanglement between the organization\u2019s premises and terrorist activities. This practice of embedding militants within civilian structures violates international law and exposes UNRWA\u2019s role, whether through negligence or tacit allowance, in facilitating these activities. The schools\u2019 use as bases for terrorism compromises the safety of civilians and challenges UNRWA\u2019s purported mission of neutrality and humanitarian support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Precautionary Measures to Protect Civilians</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the operational complexities posed by targeting sites embedded within civilian areas, the IDF took extensive steps to mitigate the risk to uninvolved civilians. These precautions included comprehensive aerial surveillance, the use of precision-guided munitions, and intelligence measures to ensure that strikes were as targeted as possible. The aim was to disrupt the operational capabilities of Hamas while minimizing harm to the civilian population that these tactics jeopardize.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hamas\u2019s Strategy of Exploitation</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas\u2019s consistent strategy of exploiting civilian structures such as schools for military purposes exemplifies its disregard for both international law and the safety of Gazan civilians. By embedding operatives within UNRWA schools, Hamas not only seeks to protect its assets from military response but also places civilians in harm&#8217;s way, using them as human shields to deter action and leverage international sympathy when conflict arises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF\u2019s recent strikes on UNRWA schools being used by Hamas operatives in Gaza City highlight an ongoing and urgent issue. UNRWA\u2019s facilities, meant to serve educational and humanitarian purposes, are systematically exploited to support terrorist operations. This pattern must prompt the international community to reexamine the oversight of UNRWA and ensure that its resources do not continue to serve as shields for violence and terror. Accountability is essential to uphold the integrity of humanitarian efforts and safeguard the civilian population from the dangers posed by such misuse.</p>\n",
