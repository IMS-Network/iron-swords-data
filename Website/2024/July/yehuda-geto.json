He was the brother of Tal, Sarit, Antenech, Andualem, Avital, and Zacharia. His parents, who worked tirelessly to support their family, raised Yehuda with strong values rooted in love, humility, and dedication to his family and community. Mollalin, a gardener for the local council of Zichron Yaakov, and Netro, who worked in the council of Pardes Hanna-Karkur, instilled in their children the importance of hard work and service to others. Yehuda grew up surrounded by the warmth and care of his large family, always ready to lend a helping hand, whether it was running errands or babysitting for his younger siblings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Military Service and Heroic Sacrifice</strong><br>Yehuda began his service to Israel with pride and dedication. On January 1, 2024, his 22nd birthday, he enlisted in the IDF and joined the Logistics Corps, where he became known for his exceptional work ethic and quiet leadership. Even after completing his regular service, he quickly found himself called back to serve in the reserves. Yehuda was attached to the Menashe Brigade as an operational driver, a role he fulfilled with great responsibility and care. His family recalls that even when he was stationed in dangerous areas, he would reassure them, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Tragically, during an operation near the Nur Shams refugee camp close to Tulkarm, Yehuda\u2019s life was cut short. On July 1, 2024, while conducting his duties with courage and commitment, Yehuda was killed by an explosive device planted on the roadside. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of Staff Sergeant (Rav Samal).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His sudden death devastated his family and community, leaving behind a profound void. His mother\u2019s heart-wrenching words\u2014\u201cThe light of my home has gone out\u201d\u2014echo the grief of a family who had just spoken with him hours before he fell. His cousin, Eitan Alma, remembered him fondly, saying, \u201cHe loved his army service and was always so proud of it. He never wanted to worry his family, always telling us he was stationed close by, even when he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Life and Achievements</strong><br>Yehuda grew up in Pardes Hanna-Karkur, attending the AMIT Yeshiva in Netivot Dror, Or Akiva, where he excelled as both a student and a friend. Teachers and classmates alike described him as a kind, soft-spoken young man with a deep love for learning and an unwavering commitment to his family and people. Rabbi Rami Kedar, the head of Yehuda\u2019s yeshiva, spoke of him as a student with \u201ca good eye and a good heart,\u201d a beloved member of the community who radiated humility and kindness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of his military and religious studies, Yehuda also had a passion for soccer, a sport he played whenever his busy schedule allowed. He would often dedicate his spare moments to the study of Torah, a reflection of his deep spirituality and his desire to connect with his heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Legacy and Remembrance</strong><br>The death of Yehuda Geto sent shockwaves through Pardes Hanna-Karkur, where he had grown up and where his family had settled after immigrating from Ethiopia. He was the ninth fallen soldier from the town in the Iron Swords War, which began on October 7, 2023. The local council, led by Yoni Hakimi, expressed the community\u2019s sorrow, stating that Yehuda was a &#8220;man of values who was raised in a precious family to love the homeland.&#8221; In a final tribute, the residents of Pardes Hanna-Karkur honored Yehuda\u2019s memory by lining the streets with Israeli flags as his funeral procession passed through, leading to his burial at the Pardes Hanna Military Cemetery.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Yehuda</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Geto</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">22</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">01 July 2024</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Menashe Territorial Brigade</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Sergeant first class (res.)\u00a0</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
