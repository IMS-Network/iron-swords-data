The only way for Hamas to survive this war is to generate international pressure on Israel to leave it alone. This is why Hamas is trying to engineer a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, to make Israel look bad. The worse things get for the people of Gaza, the better they get for their Hamas warlords.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Humanitarian Efforts and Hamas Interference</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel created humanitarian routes, but Hamas shot at them. Israel brought in aid trucks, and Hamas hijacked them. Israel marked out a humanitarian safe zone, but Hamas fired rockets from inside it. Nowhere is safe in Gaza because Hamas has made it a war zone. Israel is asking Gazan civilians to evacuate parts of the humanitarian zone in Khan Yunis for their own safety because Hamas has made it unsafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hamas&#8217; Tactics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas wants civilians to die, which is why it shoots rockets at Israeli towns from areas where Israel is trying to protect civilians. The world should be angry at Hamas and at UN agencies refusing to help evacuate civilians to safety, keeping them inside a war zone and Hamas strongholds. Recently, a Hamas rocket intended for Israel fell short and hit a Gazan school, potentially causing many deaths.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Misplaced Blame</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More than one in five rockets fired from Gaza at Israel land inside Gaza. Over the last few years, around 30,000 rockets have been fired at Israel, with over 10,000 in the last year alone. This means Gaza terror groups have fired over 6,000 rockets at Gaza itself. When a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket struck a Gaza hospital in October, international media immediately blamed Israel based on a Hamas press release. This encourages Hamas to continue endangering Gazan lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hamas and Fatah Unity Deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas and Fatah have announced a unity deal. Despite differences, they share a common goal of no Israel from the river to the sea. A recent poll showed that 57% of people in Gaza supported the October 7th massacre. The Palestinian Authority claims to want two states but chants for no Israel, indicating they want one Palestinian state and another state open to unlimited Palestinian immigration until it becomes Palestinian state number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implications of Unity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>International diplomats talking about a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza could mean letting Hamas govern Gaza through the back door. If the deal goes through, PA rule in Gaza means returning Hamas to Gaza through the front door. Hamas&#8217; warlords must be defeated, not rewarded or allowed back into Gaza in triumph.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Role of the International Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The world must stand with Israel and the people of Gaza, holding Hamas accountable. Countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have worked to deradicalize their own populations and could help rebuild Gaza sustainably. Aid should be used to rebuild Gaza as a permanent home rather than for terror tunnels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Media Access to Gaza</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel bars international journalists from entering Gaza due to security concerns. Allowing journalists could expose troop movements and put them in danger. The information coming out of Gaza often comes from local journalists who may be working for Hamas or intimidated by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Eradicating Hate in Gaza</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The people of Gaza need to realize that terrorism has led them to a dead end. The international community must stop rewarding Hamas for its actions. Palestinian children need to be taught peace and coexistence rather than jihad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Actions for Individuals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular people can help by speaking up for Israel and engaging in real conversations. It&#8217;s important to share accurate information and support the truth about the conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Israel seeks peace and safety for its people. With the support of the global community, it aims to achieve this goal.</p>\n",
