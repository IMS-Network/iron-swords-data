We examined here on the wall of the soccer field the remnants of the rocket; we can say it is a Fajr rocket with a warhead weighing fifty-three kilograms. It is a Hezbollah rocket. And anyone who fires such a rocket into a populated area wants to kill civilians, wants to kill children. We strongly support the Druze community; it is our loyal partner, alongside all other citizens of Israel, in the fight for the home, the home of all of us. We strongly support the residents of Majdal Shams, and we embrace the bereaved families and wish a swift and full recovery to all the injured. I want to tell you, residents of the north, this has already been a long time that you are not in your homes. We see the difficulty, and we will act by all means to bring you back home safely. We are significantly increasing our readiness for the next stage of combat in the north while we are simultaneously fighting in Gaza. We know how to strike far beyond the borders of Israel; there will be more challenges, and we will elevate our preparedness. When necessary, we will act strongly. Our duty is to return the residents safely to their homes in the north, across all of northern Israel, the Galilee, and the Golan Heights; it is a full obligation. This is a difficult day; we will work toward better days ahead.&#8221;</p>\n",
