During the night, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) approached from the west, likely launched from Yemen, and struck a building in central Tel Aviv. This incident resulted in the death of one civilian and minor injuries to eight others. We extend our condolences to the bereaved family and wish a swift recovery to the injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investigation and Initial Findings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no alert prior to the incident, and we are conducting a thorough investigation. Preliminary findings suggest that the UAV involved was an Iranian-made &#8220;Zamrad-3,&#8221; which likely traveled from Yemen to Tel Aviv. Iran supports, funds, and arms its proxies in the region, from Gaza and the West Bank to Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Countermeasures and Response</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The threat of UAVs is one we have faced since the beginning of the war across all borders. Dozens of UAVs have been launched from Yemen alone, most of which were intercepted by the American task force under CENTCOM or by our air force&#8217;s defense systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Concurrent Incident and UAV Interception</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At around the same time as the Tel Aviv incident, we intercepted another UAV attempting to penetrate from the east, outside Israel&#8217;s borders. We are investigating the connection between these two events and why the UAV was not identified as a threat or intercepted earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strengthening Defense</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We emphasize that our defense is not impenetrable. We are increasing our aerial patrols and overall air defense. While we are improving our capabilities to protect Israel&#8217;s citizens, there are no changes to Home Front Command guidelines. Should any changes occur, we will immediately inform the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recent Military Actions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past 24 hours in the north, we eliminated six Hezbollah militants and attacked 15 targets from the air and on the ground. We are engaged in a multi-front war, defending the skies of Israel daily. These fronts are both near and far, and we operate against all threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ongoing and Future Assessments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We will conduct situational assessments in the coming days to fully understand the source of the threat, the necessary defensive measures, and appropriate offensive responses against those threatening Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Addressing Public Concerns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To the questions from the public:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>There is no change in the Home Front Command guidelines.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Regarding the possibility of further UAV attacks, we are prepared around the clock. We encountered a significant challenge on April 13th from Iran, involving hundreds of items handled jointly with allies, and we continue to address such threats daily.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Concerning the UAV that entered last night, it was due to a failure on our part, and we are investigating this incident thoroughly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Specific Inquiries and Responses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Regarding the UAV\u2019s detection:</strong> The UAV was not a stealth aircraft, and our systems detected it. We are investigating why it was not intercepted earlier. We will publish all findings once the investigation is complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On potential future threats:</strong> Since the start of the war, the Houthis have attacked Israel, and we have responded through the international coalition. We are assessing whether direct action is needed in addition to coalition efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On public communication:</strong> We provided preliminary findings to the media within 45 minutes of the incident and informed the public shortly after. We prioritize accurate reporting over speed and will continue to update the public with verified information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On operational adjustments:</strong> We are reviewing and correcting any procedural errors. Despite human errors, our teams have successfully intercepted hundreds of threats over the past nine months and continue to work tirelessly to protect Israel.</p>\n",
