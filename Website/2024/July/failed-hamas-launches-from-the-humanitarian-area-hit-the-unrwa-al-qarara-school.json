        "rendered": "\n<p>The Hamas terrorist organization attempted to launch multiple projectiles from the Humanitarian Area in Khan Yunis, but the launches failed, causing the rockets to fall short and strike the area around the UNRWA &#8216;Al-Qarara&#8217; school. As a result, the school sustained multiple hits, leading to reports from international humanitarian organizations of two civilian deaths and several injuries. In response, the injured were evacuated, with coordination between the Coordination and Liaison Administration to Gaza in COGAT and the World Health Organization (WHO), to receive immediate medical treatment at the International Medical Corps (IMC) field hospital in Deir al-Balah, established during the conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continued rocket fire by Hamas endangers both Israeli and Gazan civilians, causing significant damage to international humanitarian infrastructure and violating international law. This incident underscores the reckless nature of Hamas&#8217; actions, which not only threaten lives but also compromise the safety and functionality of critical humanitarian facilities in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15574\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1024x576.png 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-300x169.png 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-768x432.png 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1536x864.png 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image.png 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n",
