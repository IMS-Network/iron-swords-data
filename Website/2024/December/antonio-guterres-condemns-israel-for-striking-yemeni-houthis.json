        "rendered": "\n<p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has once again exposed his pro-terrorist bias by condemning Israel\u2019s defensive airstrikes on Yemeni Houthis, a group of Iranian-backed terrorists who have been waging war on Israel and chanting genocidal slogans like <strong>\u201cDeath to Israel\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cA Curse Upon the Jews.\u201d</strong> Rather than holding the Houthis accountable for their escalating missile attacks and destabilization of the region, Guterres chose to side with the perpetrators of terror, using his platform as UN Secretary-General to demonize Israel for defending itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For over a year, the Houthis have launched missile barrages at Israel, targeting innocent civilians and turning the Red Sea into a dangerous war zone. The UN has done <strong>nothing</strong> to address this aggression. Guterres has remained silent as these terrorist actions threaten lives and regional stability. Yet, as soon as Israel takes legitimate action to protect its citizens, Guterres rushes to issue a statement condemning the strikes, calling for \u201crestraint\u201d and painting Israel as the aggressor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where was Guterres when the Houthis escalated their attacks? Where was his condemnation of their genocidal rhetoric or their indiscriminate violence? His silence speaks volumes. Guterres has consistently shielded groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis from accountability while weaponizing his role to criticize Israel at every turn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t diplomacy\u2014it\u2019s <strong>blatant support for terrorism.</strong> Guterres\u2019 statements reflect a dangerous double standard: protect the terrorists and vilify the victims. His refusal to call out the Houthis for their aggression, while condemning Israel\u2019s defensive actions, makes it clear whose side he\u2019s on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The international community must see Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for what he is: a <strong>pro-terrorist enabler</strong> who has no interest in peace or justice, only in empowering those who seek Israel\u2019s destruction. The UN under his leadership is a disgrace, an organization that has become a haven for those who sympathize with terror while abandoning the principles of human rights and international law.</p>\n",
