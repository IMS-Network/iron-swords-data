        "rendered": "\n<p>The world is talking about Gaza, and that\u2019s a good thing. But the conversations must focus on the truth\u2014the unspeakable atrocities committed by Palestinians on October 7, 2023, and the ongoing suffering inflicted by Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the facts: over 6,000 Palestinians infiltrated Israel that day, with approximately 3,800 linked to Hamas, UNRWA, and other terror organizations. About 2,200 so-called &#8220;civilians&#8221; from Gaza joined in the barbarity of this massacre. These Palestinians slaughtered men, women, and children, raped their victims, tortured them in unspeakable ways, and filmed their heinous acts for the world to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not a clash of armies. It was a calculated campaign of terror that targeted the innocent\u2014babies, women, the elderly\u2014indiscriminately. Over 1,163 were murdered, including 301 IDF heroes, 55 police officers, and 10 Shin Bet personnel. This is the reality that the world must remember and confront.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Hostages: A Humanitarian Crisis Ignored</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the horrors of October 7 is the plight of the hostages. Hamas and its supporters continue to hold over 200 civilians captive, including women, children, and the elderly. These hostages are subjected to unimaginable suffering, exploited as human shields, and used for propaganda by a terrorist organization that thrives on cruelty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where is the global outcry for their release? Why do so many ignore their plight while parroting false claims of genocide and famine in Gaza?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Misinformation: Hamas\u2019s Favorite Weapon</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrative of genocide and starvation is a deliberate lie pushed by Hamas and its enablers. The reality is starkly different: Israel has done everything possible to spare civilian lives while targeting Hamas\u2019s terror infrastructure. Humanitarian aid, including food, water, and medicine, flows into Gaza daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, Hamas hoards these supplies, redirecting them to its fighters and terror operations while ordinary Gazans suffer. Hamas doesn\u2019t care for the people it rules\u2014it uses them as tools in its war against Israel. The claims of starvation are especially absurd when contrasted with reports of Hamas leaders living in luxury and dining extravagantly in Qatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Real Genocide</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The only genocide being planned in this conflict is Hamas\u2019s explicit goal: the annihilation of the Jewish people and the destruction of Israel. Their actions on October 7 were not just an attack\u2014they were part of a genocidal ideology that glorifies murder and martyrdom at the expense of human life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel, by contrast, values life and works to minimize civilian casualties, even while fighting an enemy that hides behind its own population. Hamas builds tunnels under schools, stockpiles weapons in hospitals, and positions launch sites in residential areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Talking About Gaza\u2014But Focus on the Truth</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The world must not stop talking about Gaza. But the conversation must center on the undeniable facts. Talk about the hostages, whose suffering is ignored by those who claim to care about human rights. Talk about Hamas\u2019s use of civilians as shields, its hoarding of aid, and its lies about genocide and starvation. Talk about the real victims\u2014Israelis and innocent people trapped under Hamas\u2019s rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t let the truth be drowned out by propaganda. Keep talking about Gaza, but ensure the world hears the facts: Israel is fighting for survival against a genocidal enemy, and Hamas is the real perpetrator of misery and suffering in Gaza.</p>\n",
