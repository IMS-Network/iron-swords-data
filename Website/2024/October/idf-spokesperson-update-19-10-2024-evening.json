During the weekend, our forces continued to operate across all sectors. IDF forces are actively operating in southern Lebanon. Estimates indicate that more than 1,500 Hezbollah operatives have been eliminated since the beginning of the war. We attacked five buildings in Beirut containing hidden weapons warehouses of Hezbollah, used for strikes against Israel. Civilians were warned to evacuate before the attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah launched three missiles targeting Israel, including an attempted strike on the Prime Minister&#8217;s residence in Caesarea. Two missiles were intercepted, and the third caused property damage. The Prime Minister was not present, and the incident is under investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of rockets targeted northern Israeli settlements throughout the day, mostly intercepted or falling in open areas. Sadly, one civilian was killed in Akko, and several others were injured. We extend our condolences and wish a speedy recovery to the injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, two IDF soldiers, First Sergeant Ofir Berkovitch and Sergeant Elisha Young, were killed by a missile strike in Gaza. May their memories be blessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yahya Sinwar, a key Hamas leader responsible for orchestrating attacks, was located and eliminated in Gaza. Sinwar had been hiding underground, moving covertly across Rafah. Our forces tracked him using intelligence and were able to neutralize him after persistent efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions &amp; Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ofer Halfon:</strong> <em>Regarding the videos and documents, how long has the IDF tracked Sinwar&#8217;s movements?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sinwar moved between Hani and Rafah throughout the war. We closely monitored his activity and ultimately confirmed his location through thorough intelligence, including DNA evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yoav Even, News Aru Q12:</strong> <em>Was there an advance warning about the rocket aimed at the Prime Minister&#8217;s residence?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I cannot disclose intelligence details. The matter is under investigation, and findings will be summarized accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gal Ganot, Yediot Ahronoth:</strong> <em>Has the IDF created conditions for a hostage deal, and how is humanitarian aid managed?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Our goal is to secure the return of all abductees. The elimination of Sinwar contributes to this effort. Humanitarian aid is managed according to directives from political leadership, ensuring compliance with security protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n",
