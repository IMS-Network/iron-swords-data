The IDF continues its ground operations and airstrikes in Lebanon against terrorist targets of Hezbollah. We are focusing on damaging the organization&#8217;s command and control, as well as destroying its strategic capabilities and infrastructure in villages near the border that threaten northern residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of underground headquarters of Hezbollah&#8217;s southern front, housing commanders responsible for the plan to occupy the Galilee, have been targeted. Hezbollah&#8217;s southern front consists of three units in Adar, Netzer, and Ziz. We eliminated the commander of the Binj Bel attack area and the commander of the artillery in Dobb d Yiftah, both of whom planned attacks on nearby settlements. Additionally, four commanders in the Hajar sector responsible for raids on Ramim settlements were neutralized. These operations inflicted severe operational and morale damage to Hezbollah, with over 50 terrorists, including six commanders, eliminated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our forces continue to neutralize underground infrastructures, such as tunnels crossing near the Israeli border. Last night, we neutralized a 25-meter-long tunnel from Mohin in southern Lebanon that slightly crossed into Israeli territory near Zereit Beit. We scanned and cleared the tunnel, confirming no exit opening in Israeli territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We continue to sweep the border and nearby villages with advanced technology, thoroughly scanning for further tunnels. Rumors of additional outdoor tunnels are unverified; we have addressed known issues and remain vigilant. Operations in southern Lebanon have so far eliminated over 3,000 Hezbollah targets, including military buildings, munitions, and underground infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The forces, supported by tanks and engineering tools, maintain high morale. The Logistics and Technology Division ensures quality supplies and medical support, while Air Force planes coordinate strikes based on field intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Hezbollah launched 10 rockets at Haifa; air defense intercepted most, but two impacted built-up areas, injuring three civilians. Following this, a situation assessment led to updated Home Front Command directives, canceling classes in Kiryat tomorrow. Full instructions are available on the Home Front Command website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations also continue in Gaza. This week, targeted raids began in Jabalia to prevent Hamas\u2019s rehabilitation. On a recent visit to Nahal Oz and Kisofim, scouts emphasized the importance of efforts to secure the return of captives held by Hamas. The IDF remains committed to bringing them home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions &amp; Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>News Question 11:</strong> <em>Was Nasrallah\u2019s successor, Sepi Hadin, eliminated in Lebanon?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We conducted a precise attack on an intelligence headquarters in southern Lebanon. We will confirm details and update the public.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Another question:</strong> <em>What is the IDF&#8217;s role regarding humanitarian aid in Gaza, and how does it affect hostage recovery?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Humanitarian aid distribution is coordinated to ensure it reaches civilians without empowering Hamas. Operations aim to prevent Hamas from exploiting this aid, following political directives. Efforts to recover captives continue alongside these actions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last question:</strong> <em>Residents ask when the conflict will end; when will they find peace?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Our main task is to dismantle Hamas\u2019s military capabilities. We are conducting extensive raids to disrupt their operations. This process is challenging, but we are committed to achieving long-term security.</li>\n</ul>\n",
