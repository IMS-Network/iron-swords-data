At just 38, his life was tragically cut short during the Iron Swords War, but his legacy of service, love, and resilience remains an enduring inspiration. As a social worker, a committed family man, and a heroic combat soldier in the IDF reserves, Yishai\u2019s story is one of purpose and profound impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Answering the Call</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the morning of October 7, 2023, marked one of the darkest days in Israel&#8217;s history as Hamas unleashed a brutal massacre on Israeli civilians. The unprecedented attack took the lives of over 1,400 Israelis, wounded thousands more, and saw entire families taken hostage into Gaza. That same day, Yishai Greenbaum answered the call to defend his nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deployed with his unit to Israel&#8217;s northern front, Yishai was thrust into an escalating conflict with Hezbollah. As part of the 5030th Battalion of the Alon Brigade, he led his platoon with calm determination and exceptional courage. Yishai&#8217;s reputation as a leader extended far beyond strategy; he was known for his ability to inspire trust, foster resilience, and support his comrades in the most harrowing circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, on October 9, 2024, Yishai sustained critical injuries during a fierce battle in southern Lebanon. After fighting valiantly for his life over ten days at Rambam Hospital, he succumbed to his wounds on October 19. His death marked a profound loss for his family, his community, and his nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Devoted Family Man: Husband, Father, and Friend</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yishai\u2019s life was deeply rooted in his love for his family. Married to Hadas for 12 years, their bond was described as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime love story.\u201d Together, they built a home filled with shared dreams and unwavering support. As a father to four young children, Yishai\u2019s pride and joy lay in nurturing and guiding them. From playful moments to teaching life lessons, he ensured his children always felt his love, even amidst the demands of military service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hadas recalled his joy at the birth of their youngest child, Zohar, just six months before his passing. Yishai\u2019s foresight and love were evident in the video messages he recorded for his children, leaving them with his wisdom and affection to carry forward in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Soldier and Social Worker</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yishai\u2019s dual roles as a platoon sergeant and social worker were a rare and remarkable combination. By day, he worked for the Municipality of Lod, specializing in trauma recovery for IDF soldiers. He was deeply committed to helping others heal, whether through psychological first aid, resilience workshops, or simply being a compassionate listener.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His skills as a social worker enriched his leadership in the military. Yishai\u2019s soldiers described how he balanced discipline with humanity, ensuring both the physical and emotional well-being of his unit. During long, cold nights, he distributed blankets to his comrades. After intense shelling, he personally checked on their mental health. Through mindfulness exercises and words of encouragement, he uplifted their spirits in the darkest moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His commanding officer, Major Bar Tzarfati, poignantly described him as \u201cthe cornerstone of the platoon,\u201d a leader who led not only with skill but with his heart. Yishai\u2019s impact on his unit extended far beyond combat strategy\u2014he was a source of strength, compassion, and unity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legacy of Generosity and Kindness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yishai\u2019s life was marked by acts of giving, a trait that extended even beyond his death. As a registered organ donor, he gave others the chance to live, a final act of generosity that epitomized his selflessness. His colleagues and friends remember him as a man whose quiet strength and radiant smile left an indelible mark on everyone he met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Rabbi from Yeshivat Hesder Ramat Gan, where Yishai studied, described him as \u201cdelicate yet determined, humanistic yet steadfast.\u201d These qualities defined every aspect of his life, from his professional endeavors to his military service and family relationships.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-Z8OPNX\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"Z8OPNX\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"7WuFXe\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-7WuFXe layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-F2iQzQ\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"F2iQzQ\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"bUDSa8\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-bUDSa8 layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-Maiorq\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"Maiorq\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-eML2Nv\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-wdG1rn\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"wdG1rn\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-m1vt2N\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-aBePfV\">Yishai</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-U2HUKm\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Z75Ln0\">Greenbaum</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-I3qBAe\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wMB8XE\">38</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-QmIc4s\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-MFhCqW\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-C2NjSj\">Alon Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-uBhf96\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-EDnIGA\">Sergeant major</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rSK4ru\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
