Throughout the holiday and even now, our fighters continue to operate in Lebanon. Fighters of the 98th Division and the 36th Brigade are maneuvering in the complicated terrain, locating and destroying Hezbollah&#8217;s weapons and infrastructure in the same villages that Hezbollah planned to launch attacks on northern settlements. So far, our forces have destroyed more than 2,000 targets of Hezbollah, including buildings, weapons, and underground infrastructure. The fighters continue to collect weapons and gather significant intelligence on Hezbollah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the documentation seen here, our forces raided an underground command complex of Hezbollah and destroyed it. The forces entered a tunnel about 250 meters long, located approximately 300 meters from the border and not crossing into Israeli territory. Inside, they found kitchens and rooms allowing Hezbollah\u2019s terrorists to stay underground for extended periods. They discovered combat bags, weapons of Radwan forces ready for attack, fresh food, command rooms, and electrical and communication infrastructure. This tunnel was intended to be used by Hezbollah for attacks on settlements in the Galilee and was destroyed yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hezbollah terrorist organization has invested extensive efforts and resources into hiding its weapons underground and inside civilian buildings in villages near the border. Since the beginning of the maneuver, our forces have eliminated about 440 terrorists on the ground and from the air, including 30 commanders of various ranks, resulting in significant losses for Hezbollah since the fighting began in southern Lebanon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the eve of the holiday, it was announced that nine IDF fighters were killed in encounters with terrorists. Yesterday, two additional IDF soldiers were killed by an unmanned IED explosion originating from Iraq. In the same incident, 24 soldiers were injured, and the incident is under investigation. We wish a speedy recovery to the wounded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ground operation is supported by dozens of air force attacks, continuing across Lebanon, both in the south and more broadly. Yesterday, we targeted Hezbollah\u2019s main intelligence headquarters in the heart of Lebanon. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah\u2019s strategic capabilities were significantly damaged, causing pain to the Iranian leadership. This leadership committed a serious act by attacking the State of Israel and launching missiles toward civilian areas in the center and south of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to our defense capabilities and the responsible conduct of the public, there were limited casualties. There were also strikes at air force bases in Nabatim and Nauf, but no damage was done to the planes or equipment, and the bases remain fully functional. Our response to these criminal attacks will be determined according to directives from the political echelon, and it will be executed at a time and manner of our choosing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, IDF forces are continuing ground operations in Gaza, including in the Netzer corridor and the Rafah area. In Judea and Samaria, a joint operation by the IDF and Shebak on Thursday resulted in the elimination of the head of the Hamas infrastructure in Tulkarem, along with over 14 other terrorists. Hamas has since confirmed their affiliation with the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was decided to modify Home Front Command instructions, allowing gatherings of up to 2,000 people from the Carmel area to the south. Schools and workplaces will operate according to directives posted on the Home Front Command website. As we approach Zion Day, there are concerns about potential terrorist attacks, so we are maintaining a heightened state of readiness, with forces deployed and prepared to respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The achievements of our forces are always in our thoughts, and we remember them continuously.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions &amp; Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>News Question 12:</strong> <em>What is expected of the citizens in the coming days? Will Israel respond to Iran, and is a change expected in the assessments on the Home Front?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The recent Iranian attack targeted the State of Israel and civilian spaces. We will respond as needed, at a time and place determined by directives from the political echelon. The public and Home Front will receive immediate updates if changes occur.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>News Question 13:</strong> <em>A senior IDF official mentioned that Israel is preparing for a significant response against Iran. What does this mean?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I will not detail what a &#8220;significant&#8221; response entails. We must act with actions, not words, and will decide the timing and method accordingly. Thank you very much.</li>\n</ul>\n",
