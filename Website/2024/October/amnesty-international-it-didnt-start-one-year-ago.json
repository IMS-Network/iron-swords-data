        "rendered": "\n<p>Amnesty International&#8217;s latest video campaign, released on October 6th, 2024, one day before Israel&#8217;s marking one year the October 7th massacre, is a blatant attempt at rewriting history and diverting attention away from the brutal attacks carried out by Hamas just a year ago. The video is filled with misleading narratives designed to obscure the horrifying reality of those attacks, instead painting Israel as the sole aggressor in a long-standing conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video completely ignores the savage acts of terrorism committed by Hamas on October 7th, 2023\u2014when civilians were slaughtered, kidnapped, and tortured. Instead, the focus shifts to historical grievances, invoking events like the Nakba of 1948 and the Six-Day War of 1967, as if to suggest that the barbarity of last year&#8217;s attack was somehow inevitable or even justified. This framing serves only one purpose: to manipulate public perception by erasing the heinous acts of violence that took place that day and turning Hamas into a victim rather than the perpetrators of terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call for an immediate ceasefire, a ban on arms sales to Israel, and an end to what they label as &#8220;apartheid&#8221; is not a plea for peace. It is a thinly veiled campaign to weaken Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself against terrorist threats. By failing to hold Hamas accountable for its actions and refusing to even acknowledge the massacre of Israeli civilians, Amnesty International&#8217;s message is clear: they are more interested in advancing a political agenda that aligns disturbingly well with Hamas\u2019s long-term goals of delegitimizing and ultimately eliminating the state of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video campaign isn&#8217;t just a lapse in judgment\u2014it&#8217;s an outright betrayal of any claim to impartial human rights advocacy. It is a calculated effort to provide cover for terrorist organizations, to rewrite the narrative, and to obscure the brutal reality of the October 7th massacre, all in pursuit of a vision that aligns with the destruction of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It didn\u2019t start one year ago.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CeasefireNow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CeasefireNow</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopArmingIsrael?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StopArmingIsrael</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndIsraeliApartheid?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EndIsraeliApartheid</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CjZy3s9Ryk\">pic.twitter.com/CjZy3s9Ryk</a></p>&mdash; Amnesty UK (@AmnestyUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmnestyUK/status/1842830656939741641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n",
