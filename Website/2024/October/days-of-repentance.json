In a calculated, cowardly move, Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) fired a barrage of 181 missiles aimed directly at civilian centers across Israel, targeting every single person in the country. No one was spared \u2014 from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, to Gedera and beyond, air raid sirens echoed across the nation as families scrambled for shelter. Although Israel\u2019s Iron Dome and other air defense systems intercepted most of the missiles, some still managed to reach their targets, injuring civilians and tragically killing a &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; man in the Judea and Samaria Area. The IRGC didn&#8217;t care who they hit, as long as they spread terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a brazen, cold-blooded act of terror \u2014 an effort to punish Israel for daring to eliminate the masterminds of terror, Ismail Haniyeh and Hassan Nasrallah, who were responsible for decades of attacks against Israeli civilians. Iran\u2019s IRGC, hiding behind their proxies, issued more empty threats of \u201ccrushing retaliation\u201d if Israel dared to respond. But Israel did more than respond. Israel delivered a message loud and clear: it will not stand by while Iranian rockets rain down on its cities.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Operation Days of Repentance: Crushing Iran\u2019s Military Ambitions</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In a massive and meticulously coordinated retaliation, Israel launched <em>Operation Days of Repentance</em>. Over 100 aircraft, including the cutting-edge F-35 &#8220;Adir&#8221; stealth fighters, took off to execute a precise and devastating series of airstrikes deep inside Iran. Israel\u2019s message was unmistakable \u2014 Iran will pay a heavy price for every act of aggression. The operation targeted key military sites across Tehran, Karaj, and other strategic locations, crippling Iran\u2019s capability to wage war through its proxies. The strikes took out missile production facilities, air defense systems, and other military assets that were the backbone of the IRGC\u2019s plans to terrorize Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel showed remarkable restraint, hitting military targets only, despite the urge to cripple Iran\u2019s oil and nuclear infrastructure. Make no mistake, Israel could have gone further, but it chose to avoid broadening the conflict. Iran\u2019s brutal regime should not misinterpret this as weakness; Israel&#8217;s power, precision, and willingness to act speak for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>\u201cIran Made a Big Mistake\u201d \u2014 Israel\u2019s Resolve Is Unbreakable</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Iran\u2019s missile assault, stating bluntly, &#8220;Iran made a big mistake when they targeted our cities. Let there be no confusion: Israel will hit back, and we will do so hard.&#8221; The United States, standing firmly with Israel, had been briefed in advance of the operation. American naval ships stationed in the region helped intercept incoming missiles during Iran&#8217;s initial attack, showcasing the strength of Israel\u2019s alliances. Israel does not stand alone, and neither do its citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF\u2019s airstrikes demonstrated Israel\u2019s unmatched ability to conduct complex, long-range missions. The operation struck deep within Iran, more than 2,000 kilometers away, showcasing Israel&#8217;s strategic reach and the lethality of its air force. Israel\u2019s aircraft returned to base without a scratch, while Iran was left scrambling, its military ambitions in tatters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Iran\u2019s IRGC: A Network of Terror Faces Its Reckoning</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran\u2019s IRGC has built a network of terror across the Middle East, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to Hamas in Gaza, and armed factions in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. But this time, Israel sent a clear message to the IRGC and all its proxies: If you strike at Israel, you will be struck down. The IRGC\u2019s so-called <em>Operation True Promise 2</em> was a failed attempt to terrorize Israeli civilians, and it backfired spectacularly. Israel\u2019s precision strikes, under <em>Operation Days of Repentance</em>, have dismantled key parts of Iran&#8217;s military infrastructure and sent a clear warning \u2014 the days of unchallenged aggression are over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Broader Conflict: Israel\u2019s Readiness and Regional Security</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran thought it could target civilians without consequence. It thought Israel would be intimidated. But it underestimated Israel\u2019s resolve. The IDF\u2019s operation is a testament to Israel\u2019s unwavering commitment to its security and the safety of its people. The IDF remains on high alert, prepared to counter any retaliation, whether from Iran directly or from its proxies across the region. Israel is not just defending itself against a single adversary; it is confronting a coalition of terror masterminded by the IRGC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let there be no doubt: Israel will not hesitate to strike again. The IRGC&#8217;s days of orchestrating terror campaigns from afar are numbered. Hezbollah, Hamas, and other proxies would be wise to take heed \u2014 any attack on Israeli soil will be met with overwhelming force.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline is-animated\" data-animation=\"slideInSides\" data-filling=\"true\"><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline__line\"><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline__bar\"></div></div><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline-item__wrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline-item__card has-background\" style=\"background-color:#010000\"><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline-item__card-wrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-getwid-content-timeline-item__content-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-45 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-icon guten-element guten-itx4yl guten-icon\"><span class=\"guten-icon-wrapper circle stacked\"><i class=\"fas fa-fighter-jet\"></i></span></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-l44M6L\"><strong>02:28</strong></h2>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"\u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d4&quot;\u05dc, \u05ea\u05d0&quot;\u05dc \u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 | \u05d0\u05ea&quot;\u05e6\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7j7TPobO1o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF initiates precise airstrikes on military targets in Iran.
