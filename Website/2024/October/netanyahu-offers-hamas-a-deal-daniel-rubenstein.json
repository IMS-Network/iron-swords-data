Israeli soldiers eliminated him last week in southern Gaza. Yahya Sinwar was one of the most evil men of our lifetimes; he was the Osama Bin Laden of Gaza. The world is a better place without him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sinwar\u2019s death is an opportunity for Hamas to end the horrible war that Sinwar started when he sent thousands of Hamas terrorists into Israel on October 7th, intending to kill as many people as they could and take as many hostages as they could. Now is the time for the whole world to pressure Hamas to free the hostages, surrender, and relinquish power. Hamas has lost the war, and all that\u2019s left is for it to acknowledge that and not prolong everyone\u2019s suffering. Sinwar\u2019s death is a big blow to Hamas, but it\u2019s not the end of Hamas. Anyone who wants peace must ensure that Sinwar\u2019s death leads to the end of Hamas in power and the dismantling of Hamas\u2019s terrorist army.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calls for a ceasefire with Hamas are calls to leave Hamas in power. We\u2019re not going back to October 6th. Hamas was the government of Gaza on October 7th; it cannot be the government of Gaza again. Gaza cannot be rebuilt with Hamas\u2019s war machine still in power. The apparent leader of Hamas right now is its former leader, Khaled Meshaal, who lives in Qatar. Western countries have leverage, and Qatar must be pressured to extradite Meshaal to face justice and to press him to formally surrender and end the war that Hamas started.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Request for International Support</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I need your help. Yahya Sinwar is dead, but 101 Israeli hostages are still in Gaza. We have a chance to get them out. The Prime Minister of Israel made an offer to Hamas that everyone should hear: whoever lays down his weapon and returns our hostages, we will allow him to go out and live. Israel has offered amnesty to Hamas terrorists holding hostages in exchange for releasing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s where I need your help: I\u2019m looking for Palestinians who have told Hamas to take the offer. Palestinian President, Palestinian Authority officials, Palestinian diplomats, Palestinian civil society leaders\u2014are any of them publicly urging Hamas to surrender, release the hostages, and end the war Hamas started? I can\u2019t find anyone; maybe you can help me. Let me know in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ongoing Conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As I speak to you now, the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon continues. One hundred rockets were fired today\u2014it\u2019s only 3:00 p.m. in Israel. One hundred rockets so far today were fired from Lebanon into Israel. Sirens are constantly going off, and Israelis are running to their shelters. Yesterday, Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets and suicide drones in a series of attacks. A man was killed by shrapnel from a rocket attack near the city of Akko, and one of the suicide drones targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s home in Caesarea, over 40 miles from Lebanon. The Prime Minister and his wife were not home at the time. Despite the heavy blows to Hezbollah\u2019s leadership, the threat from Hezbollah\u2019s terrorist army in Lebanon remains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diplomats from many countries are trying to end the war, but they aren\u2019t succeeding. Here\u2019s a lesson in how <em>not</em> to do diplomacy. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said five steps should be taken with regard to Lebanon. There\u2019s one step missing\u2014see if you can spot it. Here are the five items on his list:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An immediate ceasefire.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rapid election of a president.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and the exclusive deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces in the South.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A more robust mandate for UNIFIL.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The delivery of needed humanitarian aid.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing he forgot to call for is peace. It\u2019s really that simple\u2014the goal is peace. Israel and Lebanon should be living side by side in peace as good neighbors. A better future is possible. The main obstacle to this peace is Hezbollah and the Iranian regime that supports it. You may have noticed that Borrell didn\u2019t mention Hezbollah by name in his list. Why are so many of the world\u2019s diplomats so bad at diplomacy? If you know the answer, let me know in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A Section:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1:</strong> <em>Is it true that Hezbollah\u2019s Deputy Leader Naim Qassem fled Lebanon and is now living in Iran?</em><br>If this report is true, it makes total sense for several reasons. First, Hezbollah\u2019s senior leadership has been systematically targeted by the Israeli Defense Forces, making it unsafe to be a Hezbollah leader at the moment. After a year of war, Hezbollah\u2019s leaders are targets and feel the pressure. It would make sense for a high-ranking leader to relocate to a safer place, such as Iran, where they\u2019re harder to reach. From Iran\u2019s perspective, they may want to protect their investment in Hezbollah, especially as the group is at risk in Lebanon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2:</strong> <em>Iran has downplayed its responsibility for Hezbollah\u2019s drone attack on the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s house. Do you think Iran knew Netanyahu\u2019s house was a target?</em><br>Yes, I do. Iran often tries to distance itself from Hezbollah when it\u2019s convenient, but remember, Iran is at the core of Israel\u2019s multi-front war. Hezbollah likely wouldn\u2019t have entered this conflict on October 8th without Iran\u2019s approval. The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officers in Lebanon coordinate closely with Hezbollah. It\u2019s difficult to believe that such a sensitive target as the Prime Minister\u2019s home would be chosen without Iranian knowledge or coordination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong> <em>Were Israel\u2019s plans for an attack on Iran leaked by U.S. intelligence?</em><br>There are reports today about sensitive information being leaked from the U.S. regarding Israel\u2019s preparations for an attack on Iran. This is concerning, and it\u2019s hoped that any issues around this are resolved. Regardless, the United States and Israel need to have a unified understanding of the threat posed by Iran and its proxies. Israel has no choice but to defend itself, and any differences between the U.S. and Israel should be addressed quietly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong> <em>Is Saudi Arabia moving closer to Iran, as reported by the New York Times?</em><br>Much has changed over the past year. Before October 7th, Saudi Arabia was open to normalizing ties with Israel, and the Abraham Accords had laid the groundwork for peace with multiple countries. However, Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas, have waged a war to disrupt this peace effort. Saudi Arabia is close to Iran geographically, so it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s weighing its options. However, Saudi Arabia has shown a preference for U.S. security guarantees and has previously supported normalization with Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing Remarks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s all the time we have today. Thank you for submitting questions. If you have more, find me on social media at Daniel Rubenstein. This has been the live daily briefing from the Israeli Citizen Spokesperson\u2019s Office. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Israel time, 8 a.m. Eastern. Have a wonderful day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@IsrCitizenSpox\"></a></p>\n",
