During the holiday, four IDF soldiers were killed in battles with Hezbollah terrorists in southern Lebanon: Senior Master Sergeant Mordechai Chaim Amoy, Advanced Master Sergeant Shmuel Harari, First Sergeant Aviad Niman, and Master Sergeant Shubal Ben Natan. May their memory be blessed. The IDF honors their sacrifice, and we embrace their families during this difficult time. Six other soldiers were seriously injured and have been hospitalized. We wish them a speedy recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizens are reminded to follow life-saving instructions, including entering protected areas, closing windows and doors, and staying vigilant. Currently, there are no changes to the Home Front Command directives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we celebrated Simchat Torah. Since October 7, the IDF has fought relentlessly across all sectors to restore security to residents in the south, the north, and throughout Israel. Last night, in a joint operation by the IDF and Shebak, we eliminated a terrorist leader responsible for organizing kidnappings during the brutal attack at the Nova party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In southern Lebanon, Hezbollah had been preparing for years to invade Israeli territory. Our forces are actively dismantling their military infrastructure along the border. Over the past month, our soldiers have been operating in villages and dense areas, revealing how Hezbollah turned these locations into staging areas, storing weapons and equipment for future attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example is the operation in the village of Mukhaba, where our forces uncovered and destroyed an underground headquarters used by Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan unit. The site included kitchens, weapons, and other equipment hidden underground. In total, we have struck over 300 targets, seizing more than 2,500 anti-tank missiles, RPG launchers, drones, and other combat gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home Front Command Reminder:</strong> For now, there are no changes in directives. Schools will resume, and citizens are encouraged to stay alert.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions &amp; Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ofer Halfon:</strong> <em>Is the fighting in Lebanon ending soon, and is there concern about leaving the job unfinished?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fighting continues, and we are committed to systematically clearing the border area to ensure the safety of northern residents. Over 1,500 Hezbollah terrorists have been eliminated, and we will keep up the effort until the threat is neutralized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Niran Weinstein:</strong> <em>How are operations in Jabaliya progressing, and is Hamas rebuilding there?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We have observed Hamas trying to re-establish a stronghold in Jabaliya. Our operations are ongoing, dismantling their infrastructure and targeting terrorists. Despite setbacks, we remain determined to dismantle their capabilities in the area.</li>\n</ul>\n",
