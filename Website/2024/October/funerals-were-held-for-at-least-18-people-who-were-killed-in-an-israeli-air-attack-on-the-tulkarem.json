        "rendered": "\n<p>Al Jazeera&#8217;s reporting of Israeli airstrikes on the Tulkarem refugee camp misrepresents the facts by focusing solely on Palestinian casualties without providing essential context about the nature of the targets. The IDF strike was a precision attack aimed at neutralizing a senior Hamas terrorist, Zahi Yasser Abd al-Razek &#8216;Ofi, who was actively planning a large-scale terror attack against Israeli civilians around October 7th. &#8216;Ofi had previously orchestrated attempts to carry out a car bombing in the Benjamin region in September 2023. Alongside him, other terrorists involved in significant terror activities were also targeted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not a random strike on civilians as Al Jazeera suggests. It was a counter-terror operation in response to imminent threats posed by a ticking time bomb (i.e., individuals planning immediate terror acts). In fact, prior to the attack, armed terrorists paraded through the streets of Tulkarem in a show of force following the release of a convicted terrorist. This demonstrates the active involvement of terrorists in the area, reinforcing the necessity of such a strike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By omitting these critical details, Al Jazeera&#8217;s report distorts the situation, presenting it as a unilateral aggression against innocent civilians, which aligns with their long-standing bias. This framing fits into their broader narrative that supports Hamas by consistently downplaying their terror activities and portraying Israeli defensive measures as disproportionate or unprovoked. This selective reporting enables terrorist organizations like Hamas to continue leveraging media narratives to gain international sympathy while hiding their terror operations and their use of civilian areas as shields, which is a clear violation of international law\u200b\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al Jazeera&#8217;s unwillingness to acknowledge Hamas&#8217;s direct involvement in organizing these terror attacks aligns with their tacit support of extremist groups, demonstrated by their regular failure to provide a balanced view of the conflict. This biased coverage helps fuel global misinformation, which ultimately endangers civilians on both sides by masking the true nature of Hamas&#8217;s violent and extremist ideology\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Funerals were held for at least 18 people who were killed in an Israeli air attack on the Tulkarem refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
