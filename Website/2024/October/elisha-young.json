A proud member of Israel\u2019s Hebrew Israelite community, Elisha\u2019s path was one of duty, perseverance, and love\u2014a journey tragically cut short during a fierce battle in the northern Gaza Strip. His story is one of heroism and sacrifice, a testament to the contributions and struggles of his community and the indomitable spirit of Israel&#8217;s defenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Childhood of Strength and Aspiration</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in Mitzpe Ramon, Elisha faced hardships early in life. His father passed away when he was a young boy, and his family relocated to Dimona. Despite this loss, Elisha grew into a source of strength and stability for his family, particularly for his younger brother with special needs. As a father figure and pillar of support, Elisha took on responsibilities far beyond his years, helping his mother, Osheriya, with every aspect of family life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a young age, Elisha dreamed of serving in the Israel Defense Forces. His aunt, Efrat Watzal, recalled how \u201che was determined to be a combat soldier; it was all he ever wanted.\u201d His passion and commitment to defending his country were evident to all who knew him, and he enlisted in August 2023 as a tank crew member in the 52nd Battalion of the Iron Tracks Brigade (401st Armored Division).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Soldier\u2019s Journey</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisha\u2019s dream became reality when he joined the IDF, embracing his role with pride and dedication. As a tank crewman, he stood at the forefront of Israel\u2019s defense during some of the nation\u2019s most challenging moments. On <strong>October 19, 2024</strong>, during the Iron Swords War, Elisha fought valiantly alongside his comrades in a battle in the northern Gaza Strip near Jabalia. Tragically, he fell in combat alongside Sergeant First Class Ofir Berkovich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisha\u2019s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Zafrir Har Shoshanim, described him as \u201ca person of light, a child of joy, and a soul of immense warmth.\u201d He noted the special bond Elisha had with his team, adding, \u201cYou fought like lions, and your presence uplifted everyone around you. You gave your all for your mission.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Devoted Son, Brother, and Friend</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisha\u2019s impact on his family was profound. For his mother, Osheriya, he was not only her son but her strength. \u201cHe always told me, \u2018Be strong, no matter what, we are at war,\u2019\u201d she tearfully recalled during his eulogy. \u201cI want Elisha back in my arms. I want him back.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To his younger brother, Elisha was a guide and protector, filling the role of a father with kindness and patience. His aunt described him as a \u201cquiet and shy boy with a heart of gold,\u201d whose smile could light up a room. Despite the challenges of growing up without a father, Elisha\u2019s positivity and sense of humor endeared him to all who knew him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His cousin, Aisheba, added, \u201cElisha, I want you to know we love you. We\u2019ll always be here for your mother and your family. You\u2019ve left a hole in our hearts that nothing can fill.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Community Mourns Its First Fallen Hero</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisha Young was the first soldier from Dimona\u2019s Hebrew Israelite community to fall in combat. His death brought a wave of grief to this tight-knit group, whose members have lived and contributed to Israeli society for over five decades. As a permanent resident of Israel, not a full citizen, Elisha\u2019s sacrifice has brought renewed attention to the challenges faced by his community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hebrew Israelite community has a proud tradition of service, with 100% of eligible members enlisting in the IDF. Yet many remain without citizenship, living under the constant threat of deportation despite their deep ties to Israel. At Elisha\u2019s funeral, Dimona Mayor Benny Bitton made an impassioned plea: \u201cPrime Minister, I ask you\u2014grant full citizenship to this extraordinary community. They have given so much to Israel, and now they\u2019ve given their first hero. Let\u2019s honor Elisha\u2019s memory by ensuring his community is recognized and valued.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Legacy of Service and Advocacy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisha\u2019s story is not only one of personal sacrifice but also a call for change. His aunt, Efrat, emphasized the injustice of a system where young men like Elisha can serve and die for Israel without full rights as citizens. \u201cHis death should wake people up. Members of our community are soldiers, students, and contributors to Israeli society. We shouldn\u2019t have to fight for our citizenship while defending this country.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisha\u2019s death has become a rallying cry for equal rights for the Hebrew Israelite community, sparking conversations about the intersection of service, belonging, and recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Nation Honors Its Hero</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On <strong>October 20, 2024</strong>, hundreds gathered at the military cemetery in Dimona to pay their final respects to Elisha. His mother, family, and community wept for their loss while celebrating his life and bravery. As the IDF saluted its fallen soldier, the words of his commanding officer echoed in the hearts of all present: \u201cElisha, you were a source of pride for your family, your community, and your country. You gave everything, and we will never forget you.\u201d</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-nYPXwo soldier-details-sidebar\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"nYPXwo\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"DXowUj\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-DXowUj layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-fLZJXO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"fLZJXO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"adJQpi\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-adJQpi layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-IQkWmc\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"IQkWmc\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-JJ6sXY\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-65IpiU\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"65IpiU\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-DyXVsv\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-5lMA7F\">Elisha</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-GmL7IX\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Xttzkn\">Young</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4opokL\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-ULt2cb\">19</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-CEJK6g\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-441YuD\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4roDIo\">401st Brigade</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-iWT9oL\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NXuB23\">Sergeant</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-t9AbOi\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
