While they cloak themselves in the language of human rights and justice, their silence in the face of the slaughter, torture, and kidnapping of Israeli civilians by Hamas betrays their true priorities. Their one-sided calls for a ceasefire are nothing more than a smokescreen to shield Palestinians from accountability, allowing these terrorists to regroup and continue their campaign of violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amnesty International&#8217;s agenda aligns disturbingly well with Palestinians goals. By exclusively condemning Israel&#8217;s actions while turning a blind eye to the brutality of the Palestinians, they provide a moral cover for these terrorists. They seek not just to halt Israel&#8217;s defensive operations but to dismantle the nation&#8217;s right to exist, all while ignoring the suffering of Israeli victims. Their silence on the massacre of October 7th is a loud and clear signal that they share Palestinians&#8217;s vision of undermining Israel through any means necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: Amnesty International&#8217;s stance isn&#8217;t just misguided\u2014it\u2019s complicit. By lending legitimacy to Palestinian Hamas, they show that they aren&#8217;t merely calling for peace; they&#8217;re standing in the corner of those who seek Israel&#8217;s destruction. Supporting Amnesty International under these circumstances means standing with an organization that would rather empower terrorists than protect innocent lives. They share the same end goal as Palestinians\u2014the erosion and ultimate eradication of the State of Israel.</p>\n",
