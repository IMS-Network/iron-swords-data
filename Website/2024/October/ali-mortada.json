        "rendered": "\n<p>Ali Mortada, a Lebanese journalist and war correspondent, is an outspoken advocate for Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist organization known for its violent acts against Israel and destabilizing influence in Lebanon. Far from being a neutral journalist, Mortada has used his platform, particularly through <em>Al Mayadeen TV</em>, to promote Hezbollah\u2019s terrorist activities and push an anti-Israel narrative. His provocative segments, such as his infamous &#8220;Hello, my enemies&#8221; address aimed directly at Israelis, are blatant attempts to legitimize Hezbollah\u2019s violence and manipulate public opinion in favor of terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah is not a &#8220;resistance&#8221; movement\u2014it is a terrorist organization responsible for numerous attacks on civilians and ongoing violence in the region. Mortada plays a significant role in glorifying these acts of terror, often reporting from areas near the Lebanon-Israel border to highlight Hezbollah\u2019s unchecked military presence. He portrays Israel as the aggressor, even as Hezbollah\u2019s terror operations, including rocket attacks targeting Israeli civilians, continue to escalate tensions. Mortada&#8217;s support for Hezbollah is clear\u2014he consistently frames their terrorist acts as heroic &#8220;resistance&#8221; and aligns himself with their extremist ideology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortada has gone beyond typical reporting by openly wishing harm upon Israeli civilians, reportedly saying, &#8220;May you have very bad luck and may you all die.&#8221; Such statements reveal his deep-rooted hostility toward Israel and highlight his complicity in supporting a terrorist organization whose goal is not just opposition to Israel but its destruction, all while advancing Iran\u2019s influence in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortada\u2019s controversial position as a journalist is not about objective reporting\u2014he is a key player in Hezbollah\u2019s propaganda machine. His work serves to legitimize the terror group\u2019s violent actions, from targeting civilians to spreading chaos across the Middle East. Following or supporting Mortada means endorsing the violent terrorism that Hezbollah stands for.</p>\n",
