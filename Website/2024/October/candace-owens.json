        "rendered": "\n<p>Candace Owens is an anti-Israel extremist, a terrorist sympathizer, and a conspiracy theorist whose rhetoric openly aligns with those who support Hamas. Her latest statements go beyond controversial\u2014they are a full-scale attack on Israel, echoing the dangerous narratives that terrorist groups use to justify their brutality. Owens\u2019s words reveal her as someone who stands with Hamas, parroting their talking points and undermining Israel&#8217;s right to defend itself against acts of terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By claiming, &#8220;Our country is being held hostage by Israel,&#8221; and shamelessly admitting, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna get in so much trouble for that, I don&#8217;t even care,&#8221; Owens exposes her embrace of antisemitic conspiracy theories that paint Israel as a manipulative force controlling global politics. She isn\u2019t just criticizing Israel; she is endorsing the vile propaganda that fuels hatred against Jews and justifies the very violence that terrorists like Hamas unleash on innocent civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her claims that &#8220;if you do not\u2026 say things that are pro-Israel\u2026 you can lose everything&#8221; only deepen her alignment with antisemitic conspiracy theories, the same lies used by extremists to incite hatred and violence against Jewish communities worldwide. Owens is openly promoting the idea that Jews wield an unfair influence over media and politics\u2014a classic antisemitic trope that has inspired violence and discrimination for centuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candace Owens has positioned herself squarely in the camp of Hamas supporters. By lending her voice to these dangerous ideologies, she legitimizes the terror organization\u2019s brutal actions, including the massacre of civilians on October 7, 2023. Her rhetoric is not merely criticism; it is a call to arms for those who seek to destroy Israel and spread hate.</p>\n",
