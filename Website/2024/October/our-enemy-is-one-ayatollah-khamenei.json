        "rendered": "\n<p>The speech from Ayatollah Khamenei on &#8220;Friday prayers&#8221; and the message being conveyed emphasize a narrative of Muslim solidarity against what is framed as a common enemy, specifically mentioning Israel. This rhetoric is in line with Iran&#8217;s broader regional strategy, where they portray themselves as defenders of Palestinians, Lebanese (Hezbollah), and other Muslim populations against what they describe as oppression and tyranny from external forces, particularly Israel and the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khamenei shamelessly glorifies Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran&#8217;s vile actions, calling massacres and terrorism &#8220;lawful resistance.&#8221; But let\u2019s be clear: these groups, along with Iran, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and militias in Syria and Iraq, are all murderous terrorist organizations whose sole mission is the destruction of Israel. Every day, they target Israeli civilians and undermine peace. Their brutality is beyond any recognition\u2014it\u2019s a fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Khamenei&#8217;s speech further solidifies Iran\u2019s role as a central backer of these groups, underscoring its proxy strategy across the region. Hezbollah&#8217;s involvement in attacking Israel from the north since October 8, 2023, along with similar efforts by Hamas and others, highlights the extensive network of Iranian-backed terror groups operating across multiple fronts. This underscores Israel&#8217;s security concerns, as it faces simultaneous threats from Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian proxies, often operating from different countries, including Syria and Iraq.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s actions, on the other hand, are focused on countering these terrorist organizations, defending its civilian population, and responding to continuous missile attacks and acts of terrorism. The hostage crisis in Gaza, where over 100 Israeli civilians are still held by Hamas, further demonstrates the brutal tactics employed by these groups and the need for Israel to safeguard its citizens\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing war Israel is engaged in involves a complex network of Iranian-backed forces, including Hezbollah and Hamas, which continue to pose a significant threat to its national security and civilian population.</p>\n",
