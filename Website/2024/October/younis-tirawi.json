His so-called investigative reporting is nothing more than an active, unapologetic promotion of groups that engage in terrorism. Tirawi regularly collaborates with and glorifies terror groups such as Hamas and others in the West Bank, including those responsible for the horrific massacre on October 7, 2023, which saw the slaughter of innocent civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make no mistake: Tirawi isn&#8217;t simply reporting on these groups\u2014he is actively engaging with them, supporting their operations, and amplifying their hateful ideology. His contacts with groups like Hamas, the &#8220;Lion\u2019s Den,&#8221; and other militants aren&#8217;t neutral sources. These are terrorists, and by working so closely with them, Tirawi positions himself as one of their key sympathizers. Israeli media, specifically Channel 13, has <em>rightly</em> labeled him as \u201cserving Hamas,\u201d not based on speculation but on his undeniable actions that align with Hamas\u2019s terrorist agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tirawi has shown time and again that his loyalties lie with Hamas, a group responsible for the brutal massacre on October 7. His reporting not only reflects his support for these violent organizations but actively seeks to legitimize their actions. There is no room for ambiguity here: Younis Tirawi stands with Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization that thrives on violence, terrorism, and the blood of innocents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who follows or supports Tirawi is backing someone who glorifies terrorism and violence. Supporting him is supporting Hamas, a group that commits acts of terror without remorse. Tirawi\u2019s actions are a direct endorsement of terrorism, and anyone aligning with him must be held accountable for standing with those who commit mass murder in the name of jihad.</p>\n",
