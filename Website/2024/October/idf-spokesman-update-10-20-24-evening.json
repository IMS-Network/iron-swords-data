Today, in an encounter in the north of the Gaza Strip in the Jabaliya area, the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade, Major General Ahsan Daksa, was killed, and a battalion commander was seriously injured. Two other officers were lightly wounded. The commanders had entered the area in tanks and exited to conduct observations when they came under attack. Ahsan led operations in northern Gaza, from Rafah to Jabaliya, and was known as an outstanding officer, commander, and humble fighter who served in multiple combat roles throughout his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahsan, 41, left behind a wife and three children. Representatives of the IDF delivered the difficult news to his family in Dalit Al Carmel, marking a harsh reminder of the ongoing war. We salute the fallen and their families, offering support during this painful time. The 401st Brigade continues to fight under new leadership, spearheading attacks in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, dozens of rockets were launched at northern settlements. We will soon issue evacuation warnings to residents in Lebanon and other areas, targeting sites linked to Hezbollah&#8217;s funding activities. Many targets will be hit in the coming hours, with more strikes planned for tonight. In the coming days, we will reveal how Iran supports Hezbollah using civilian organizations as fronts for terrorist financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions &amp; Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Are plans to attack Iran delayed due to a Pentagon leak, and was an explanation sought from the U.S.?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We do not comment on such details in the media. Under political direction, we will act as necessary. Cooperation with American Central Command continues, and operational plans remain confidential.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anna Pines, News:</strong> <em>A document from October 7 was sent to the IDF and police, why were actions not taken after the alert?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Investigations are ongoing, and we have not completed our review of documents and alerts from that night. We remain focused on fighting in Lebanon, Gaza, and other potential threats, while also engaged in these investigations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hagari:</strong> <em>Three days before Simchat Torah, the Southern Command has not yet taken responsibility. Why haven&#8217;t resignations occurred?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Chief of Staff has taken responsibility and leads our operational efforts. The Southern Command\u2019s conduct during the fighting has shown effective leadership, and accountability will be addressed at the appropriate time</li>\n</ul>\n",
