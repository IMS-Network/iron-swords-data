They won&#8217;t be targeted when they&#8217;re inside a hospital. Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, Sheik Hamed Hospital, Rantisi Hospital, Alifa Hospital, and Al hospital. What do all these hospitals have in common? Well, let&#8217;s break it down. I know 16 employees in the hospital: a doctor, a nurse, a paramedic, or clerks who also have different positions in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, Hamas has strategically placed terrorist infrastructure around sensitive civilian areas such as schools, kindergartens, and mosques. The terrorist infrastructure is placed in these areas in order to exploit the civilians of Gaza as human shields and protective vests for Hamas terrorists. Side note: this is a blatant violation of international law. By taking advantage of the IDF&#8217;s commitment to the laws of armed conflict and international humanitarian law, Hamas&#8217;s presence in hospitals is meant to ensure optimal protection for terrorists during times of war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, terrorists aren&#8217;t just hiding there in plain sight. There are also command and control centers, armaments, and even rocket launch posts in these hospitals. And here&#8217;s your evidence: this Hamas terrorist was exposed while casually carrying an RPG into the Alud hospital located in southern Gaza. Inside of Alifa Hospital in Gaza City, large amounts of weapons were found in the MRI building, a weapon storage unit was found in the Cardiology Ward, and explosives were found in the Physiotherapy Ward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is just scratching the surface. If we delve a little deeper, like beneath the ground deeper, you&#8217;ll find an underground network of terrorist tunnels leading from hospitals to nearby assets. Watch: this is one of the senior terrorists who is the head of naval operations that led the raids into Israel. His house is 200 yards from the hospital, the hospital of Rantisi. Next to his house, there is a tunnel. The tunnel is led down more than 20 meters, down a door that is bulletproof and explosives-proof. So, it looks like clear evidence that the hospital direction is connected. This is Rantisi Hospital, and this is the place where I showed you the tunnel I want you to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the real harm being inflicted on Gazan civilians stems from the effect of secondary explosions. Hamas continues to launch rockets from within hospital grounds despite knowing that their rockets are likely to fail mid-launch, further endangering the lives of patients and hospital staff. Altogether, hospitals have become a key word in this solely because Hamas has made it that way. As long as Hamas holds a presence within hospitals across Gaza, so will our forces. For the safety of Israeli and Gazan civilians alike, the IDF will continue to operate to dismantle Hamas.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-hI2Yki\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"hI2Yki\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-KElhmZ\">Hamas</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element gutenverse-text-editor guten-STtTwf\"><div class=\"text-content-inner\">\n<p>Hamas, established in 1987, has evolved from a violent offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood into a powerful political-military entity in the Middle East. Under the leadership of Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, Hamas has become a significant regional actor, particularly in Gaza, where its military, political, and ideological activities have profound implications for regional security, especially concerning its tension with Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ideology</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas&#8217;s ideology is rooted in Sunni Islamic fundamentalism, with key objectives including the establishment of an Islamic state in the region and the slaughter of all Jews in the world, as well as the elimination of Israel through armed struggle. These goals are clearly stated in Hamas&#8217;s founding charter and other official statements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Official Flag</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_.png\" alt=\"Hamas Terror Organization\" class=\"wp-image-226\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_.png 2560w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_-300x188.png 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_-1024x640.png 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_-768x480.png 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_-1536x960.png 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hamas.svg_-2048x1280.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hamas</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Order of Battle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas commands approximately 40,000 to 50,000 fighters, including 25,000 active duty troops and various reserve units.
