It&#8217;s not just about the symbols; it&#8217;s about the strong bond this community has with Israel. Sendal is a small county in Norway, and its residents are Christians who firmly stand with Israel. It&#8217;s a testament to the power of faith and resilience to stand with the Jewish nation, over 3,000 km away from this amazing green county.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal Testimony</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Daily Blessing</strong> &#8220;This way is Jerusalem, and every morning and every evening, I stand and I pray and bless Jerusalem, Israel, and Judea. This is a blessing for me.&#8221; In a world where Israel often faces criticism and hostility, Sendal shines as a beacon of support and solidarity. This county knows the truth: that Israel is a land of freedom, democracy, and resilience, and that it&#8217;s not the problem but the solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Historical Significance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Legacy of Israel</strong> First of all, we are taught to love the people of the Bible, God&#8217;s chosen people who gave us the Bible, the Messiah, good values, and morals. The people of Sendal understand that Israel is not just a country; it&#8217;s a promise, a sanctuary, a beacon of hope for Jews and Christians alike. Israel&#8217;s history is rich and deeply significant. It&#8217;s the birthplace of the Jewish people, the land where the Bible came to life, and the site of many pivotal moments in human history. From the ancient kingdoms of David and Solomon to the modern state founded in 1948, Israel&#8217;s story is one of survival, innovation, and faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Modern Israel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Thriving Nation</strong> Despite facing numerous wars, relentless criticism, and terrorist attacks, Israel has not only survived but thrived. Israel stands as the only democracy in the Middle East, a region plagued by tyranny and conflict. It&#8217;s a land where Jews, Christians, and Muslims can live and worship freely. Israel&#8217;s contributions to science, technology, and culture are remarkable for such a small nation. It&#8217;s a country that turns deserts into blooming fields and innovates in ways that benefit the entire world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Message of Support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Power of Solidarity</strong> The support for Israel in Sendal is a powerful message that truth and justice still matter. As it says in the Book of Genesis 12:3, &#8220;I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and all people will be blessed through you.&#8221; It&#8217;s very important to support Israel because they are on the frontline against terrorism and hate. Israel is a light for the nations, and by standing with Israel, the people in Sendal send a strong message about their faith and values. They stand for democracy, freedom, and human rights, and the right of the Jewish people to live in their ancestral homeland.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Visit to Sendal</strong> So, if you&#8217;re in Norway, make sure you pay a visit to Sendal to see a small community with a giant heart that stands with Israel proudly. They are unashamed, not afraid of criticism or hatred. All they care about is standing on the right side of history, standing with the Jewish people. For me, as an Israeli, it&#8217;s just amazing to be here. I feel at home; it feels like a new Israel. Sending you love from Sendal.</p>\n",
