        "rendered": "<h2>Closure of Crossings on Saturdays</h2>\n<p>In line with the agreement reached with the US, Egypt, and the UN, the crossings will be closed on Saturdays. This closure is intended to facilitate the UN&#8217;s distribution of goods on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom.</p>\n<h2>Aid Trucks and Coordination Efforts</h2>\n<p>A total of 187 trucks of aid were picked up on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom by UN bodies. Currently, there are nearly 450 aid trucks waiting on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom for pickup (as of June 1). Additionally, 40 humanitarian aid trucks were transferred to northern Gaza through the Jordanian route (as of June 1).</p>\n<p>Out of 37 overall coordination requests, 30 were approved (as of June 1). Specifically, out of 11 coordination requests to northern Gaza, 9 were approved, and out of 14 UN coordination requests, 11 were approved. Since January 1, 2024, 88% of all coordination requests have been approved.</p>\n<h2>Expansion of Medical Facilities</h2>\n<p>A new maternity complex was established at the International Medical Corps (IMC) field hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, donated by UNFPA. Additionally, two new generators began operating as part of the hospital expansion. These generators, coordinated last week, will increase the hospital&#8217;s capacity to accommodate approximately 200 patients at once, which is four times the hospital&#8217;s current capacity.</p>\n<h2>Evacuations and Humanitarian Efforts</h2>\n<p>So far, 3,273 injured and sick individuals and 754 escorts have been evacuated from the strip (as of June 1). Furthermore, today, June 2, between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Al Bashiti neighborhood in Khan Yunis to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
