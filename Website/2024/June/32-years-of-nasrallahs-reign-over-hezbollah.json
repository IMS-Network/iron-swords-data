Today marks 32 years since he became Hezbollah&#8217;s Secretary General. Here are five things you need to know about Nasrallah&#8217;s time in power:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hiding in a Bunker</strong>: Nasrallah has been hiding in a bunker since 2006 and never appears in public. The Hezbollah leader very rarely makes public appearances and preaches anti-Israel and anti-Western ideologies from an undisclosed location.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drug Trafficking Network</strong>: Nasrallah developed a worldwide network of drug trafficking and money laundering to fund Hezbollah&#8217;s terrorist agenda. Lebanon became a transit country for cocaine in 2008. Authorities at the Frankfurt airport seized $13.4 million in cash located in the luggage of four Lebanese travelers connected to Hezbollah&#8217;s drug trafficking ring.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Global Terrorist Attacks</strong>: During Nasrallah&#8217;s reign, Hezbollah has committed terrorist attacks all around the world, including in Argentina, Bulgaria, and Saudi Arabia.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strong Ties to Iran</strong>: Nasrallah has incredibly strong ties to Iran. In the mid-1980s, Nasrallah completed religious studies in Iran and formed close relationships with Iran&#8217;s political and military elite. Nasrallah also became Hezbollah&#8217;s representative to Iran in 1989 and has since served as the Iranian regime&#8217;s main point of contact in Lebanon, as well as the head of their most valued proxy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Educational Programs</strong>: Hezbollah runs educational programs for kids, including summer camps that teach children to support terrorist ideologies and to incite violence against the West. These children are forced to swear their loyalty to Nasrallah and his ideology.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past 32 years, Nasrallah has not only continued to attack Israel but has proven that his hateful incitement against the West are not just empty words, but rather a promise of what is to come.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-hI2Yki\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"hI2Yki\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-KElhmZ\">Hezbollah</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element gutenverse-text-editor guten-STtTwf\"><div class=\"text-content-inner\">\n<p>Hezbollah, established in 1982, has grown from a small militia to a formidable political-military entity in the Middle East. Under the leadership of Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah has become a significant regional actor, particularly in Lebanon, where its military, political, and ideological activities have profound implications for regional security, especially concerning its tension with Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ideology</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah&#8217;s ideology is rooted in Shiite radicalism, with key objectives including the establishment of an Islamic Republic in Lebanon, the elimination of Israel through armed struggle, and resistance against American hegemony and capitalist forces. These goals are detailed in Hezbollah&#8217;s manifestos from 1985 and 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Order of Battle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah commands approximately 50,000 to 100,000 fighters, including 20,000 active duty troops and 25,000 reservists. The elite Radwan Unit, comprising thousands of operatives, plays a crucial role in the group&#8217;s strategic operations, including incursions into Israeli territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Official Flag</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hezbollah.svg_.png\" alt=\"Hezbollah Terror Organization Flag\" class=\"wp-image-229\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hezbollah.svg_.png 640w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Flag_of_Hezbollah.svg_-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Hezbollah</figcaption></figure>\n</div></div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
