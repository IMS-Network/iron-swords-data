During this coordinated assault, they kidnapped numerous children, women, and elderly people from their homes and communities. These innocent civilians are still being held captive, their fates unknown, causing immense pain and anxiety for their families. The deliberate targeting and abduction of non-combatants during this attack highlight the extreme brutality and inhumanity of the perpetrators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These actions constitute a clear violation of international law and are widely recognized as war crimes. The Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibit the taking of hostages and the targeting of civilians, yet these fundamental principles were egregiously ignored. The kidnapping and ongoing detention of these vulnerable individuals underscore the severity of the crime and its profound impact on the affected families and communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terror attack on October 7, 2023, has left deep scars on the survivors and has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community. The continued captivity of the kidnapped children, women, and elderly people remains a poignant reminder of the atrocities committed on that day, underscoring the urgent need for justice and the safe return of all hostages.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-jUgxFc\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"jUgxFc\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-10-gazans.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5061\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-10-gazans.jpg 2048w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-10-gazans-300x200.jpg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-10-gazans-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-10-gazans-768x512.jpg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7-10-gazans-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></figure>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"J1F91Z\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-J1F91Z layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-5HTqxJ\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"5HTqxJ\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"528\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rsz_615_346_1ice20122023.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5063\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rsz_615_346_1ice20122023.jpg 528w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rsz_615_346_1ice20122023-300x186.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" /></figure>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VAxgvL\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"VAxgvL\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"guten-element gutenverse-text-editor guten-Hk0d00\"><div class=\"text-content-inner\">\n<p>Gazan citizens were responsible for the abduction of Noa Argamani from a peace party, as evidenced by the video they recorded and published.

This startling fact highlights a troubling aspect of the situation, as the journalist, who is expected to uphold principles of truth and integrity, was involved in holding a hostage. The presence of Noa in their home raises serious questions about the involvement of individuals in supposedly neutral professions in such egregious activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abduction video of Noa provides further insight, suggesting that Abdallah Aljamal was the one riding the bike during her kidnapping. This footage has been crucial in piecing together the events of her abduction and the identities of those involved. The video vividly captures the moment Noa was forcibly taken, highlighting the distress and terror she experienced during her kidnapping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initiated a rescue operation to free Noa from her captors in the Nuseirat refugee camp, they faced fierce resistance. Hamas and their accomplices began shooting at both Noa and the IDF, turning the rescue mission into a combat situation. This intense firefight resulted in casualties among Gazan citizens, though the exact number of those who died remains unknown. The involvement of a journalist in such a serious crime adds a complex layer to the narrative, challenging the perceived neutrality and ethical standards of the profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tragic series of events underscores the severe risks and violence faced by those involved and highlights the complexities of the conflict in the region. It also calls attention to the shocking reality that individuals in positions of influence and supposed impartiality, such as journalists, can sometimes be complicit in acts of terrorism and hostage-taking. The rescue operation and subsequent combat emphasize the volatile and dangerous nature of the situation, impacting not only the direct participants but also the broader community.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-aFaY4U\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"aFaY4U\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-was-imprisoned-behind-luctury-hyper-mall-in-a-refugee-camp-by-an-aljazeera-juornalist-and-a-doctor-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5064\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-was-imprisoned-behind-luctury-hyper-mall-in-a-refugee-camp-by-an-aljazeera-juornalist-and-a-doctor-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-was-imprisoned-behind-luctury-hyper-mall-in-a-refugee-camp-by-an-aljazeera-juornalist-and-a-doctor-300x300.jpg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-was-imprisoned-behind-luctury-hyper-mall-in-a-refugee-camp-by-an-aljazeera-juornalist-and-a-doctor-150x150.jpg 150w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-was-imprisoned-behind-luctury-hyper-mall-in-a-refugee-camp-by-an-aljazeera-juornalist-and-a-doctor-768x768.jpg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-was-imprisoned-behind-luctury-hyper-mall-in-a-refugee-camp-by-an-aljazeera-juornalist-and-a-doctor.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2KcXbF\">civilians holding hostages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The involvement of civilians in holding hostages is a deeply troubling aspect of the conflict. <br>If the goal is to prevent civilian casualties, several measures must be taken:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Do not send civilians to abduct innocent people:</strong> This act places them in direct harm&#8217;s way and escalates violence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do not keep abducted individuals near civilian populations:</strong> This endangers both the hostages and the local residents.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Return the abducted individuals to Israel:</strong> This straightforward solution can avert further conflict and potential loss of life.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-TytH8K\">The un resolution in this subject</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"zHFGSu\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-zHFGSu layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-y48Qb2\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"y48Qb2\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<p>According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, individuals or entities that facilitate the commission of terrorist acts by Hamas, act on behalf of Hamas, or support or provide safe havens to Hamas, are committing serious criminal offenses. The resolution mandates that all states must &#8220;freeze without delay funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts&#8221;. This includes entities controlled directly or indirectly by such persons, and those acting on their behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Resolution 1373 requires states to &#8220;deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts, or provide safe havens&#8221;. It emphasizes that claims of political motivation should not be recognized as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition of alleged terrorists, ensuring that perpetrators cannot evade justice by exploiting political asylum processes. The resolution also stresses the importance of not granting refugee status to those who have planned, facilitated, or participated in terrorist acts, in order to prevent the abuse of refugee protection by terrorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This resolution makes it clear that civilians who hide hostages or collaborate with Hamas are not innocent bystanders. By providing shelter, support, or any form of assistance to Hamas, these individuals are participating in and facilitating terrorist activities. This makes them complicit in the crimes committed by Hamas and subject to the same international legal consequences. The resolution aims to disrupt and prevent the support networks that enable terrorist activities, reinforcing the message that any form of collaboration with terrorist groups is a serious offense. The intention is to hold all individuals accountable, ensuring that those who aid and abet terrorism cannot claim innocence or evade justice under the guise of being civilians.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-WMbCcy\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"WMbCcy\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div data-wp-interactive=\"core/file\" class=\"wp-block-file\"><object data-wp-bind--hidden=\"!state.hasPdfPreview\" hidden class=\"wp-block-file__embed\" data=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/res_1373_english.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:750px\" aria-label=\"Embed of res_1373_english.\"></object><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-7ec81bc5-0abd-47af-9018-a51122aee620\" href=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/res_1373_english.pdf\">res_1373_english</a><a href=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/res_1373_english.pdf\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-7ec81bc5-0abd-47af-9018-a51122aee620\">Download</a></div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"ZPM270\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-ZPM270 layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-I5gljt\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"I5gljt\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"908\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pcpsr-2023.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5062\" style=\"object-fit:cover\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pcpsr-2023.png 908w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pcpsr-2023-300x156.png 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pcpsr-2023-768x398.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" /></figure>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-4AJ9l2\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"4AJ9l2\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"guten-element gutenverse-text-editor guten-F8PeC6\"><div class=\"text-content-inner\">\n<p>According to the latest poll, 57% of Gazans support the October 7 attack by Hamas, indicating that the majority of the population in the Gaza Strip views this offensive against Israel as justified.
