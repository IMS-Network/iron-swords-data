This site was being used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute numerous attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops. The strike was meticulously planned and executed with precision munitions to minimize any potential harm to civilians in the surrounding area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, the 162nd Division continues to carry out intelligence-based operations in Rafah. Over the past day, troops identified significant terror tunnel shafts and uncovered a large cache of weapons, including RPGs, ammunition, explosive barrels, AK-47 rifles, and additional explosive devices. Meanwhile, the 99th Division continues its operations in central Gaza, with the 2nd Brigade dismantling numerous terror infrastructure sites and seizing substantial amounts of weapons and military equipment used by Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last 24 hours, IAF fighter jets and other aircraft struck approximately 65 terror targets across Gaza. These targets included military compounds, weapon storage facilities, launch sites, observation posts, terrorist cells, and various other military infrastructure. The coordinated strikes and operations continue to degrade Hamas&#8217; capabilities and support IDF ground troops in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Strike on Military Structure in Which Hamas Terrorists Were Operating Within an UNRWA School\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0_mGwk9QJA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",
