A shield for Hamas militants who murdered the elderly, raped women, burned children, and kidnapped Jews, Muslims, and Christians during their massacre on October 7th.</p>\n<p>When we say that we cannot allow October 7th to happen again at any of our borders \u2013 we mean it.</p>\n<p>Due to Hezbollah&#8217;s refusal to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1701, due to Hezbollah&#8217;s military infrastructure, the fire and shots directed towards Israel from the area south of the Litani River in southern Lebanon, and due to Lebanon&#8217;s failure to enforce 1701 on Hezbollah \u2013 Israel will take all necessary measures to protect its citizens until security is restored along the Lebanon border.</p>\n<p>In one way or another \u2013 we will ensure the safe return of Israelis to their homes in northern Israel.
