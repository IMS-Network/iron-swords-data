The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) clarified that their forces adhered to protocol while transporting a wounded Palestinian man to medical treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF confirmed the incident after it was captured on video and shared on social media. According to the IDF, the man was injured during an exchange of fire in the raid, where he was a suspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to earlier reports, the injured man&#8217;s family had asked for an ambulance, and he was transported by the IDF to the Red Crescent for medical care. The video showing the man strapped to the front of a vehicle was taken during a brief segment of the transport, covering approximately 70 meters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This morning [Saturday], during counter-terrorism operations to apprehend wanted suspects in the area of Wadi Burqin, terrorists opened fire at IDF troops, who responded with fire,&#8221; the IDF statement said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;During the exchange of fire, one of the suspects was injured and apprehended. In violation of orders and standard operating procedures, the suspect was transported by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle. The conduct seen in the video does not conform to the values of the IDF. The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eyewitnesses speaking to Reuters news agency identified him as a local man and named him as Mujahed Azmi. The IDF noted that the suspect agreed to be transported in this manner due to the lack of space in the vehicle, and the journey to the Red Crescent was very short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas&#8217;s deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UN reports* that at least 480 Palestinians, including members of terror organizations , terrorists, and civilians, have been killed in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
