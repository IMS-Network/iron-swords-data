Out of these, <strong>190 trucks</strong> entered through the <em>Kerem Shalom Crossing</em>, while <strong>30 trucks</strong> utilized the <em>Erez West crossing</em>. However, only <strong>70 trucks</strong> were collected by UN aid agencies throughout the day.</p>\n<h2>Pending Aid Trucks</h2>\n<p>The content of <strong>1,000 aid trucks</strong> is still waiting to be collected from the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom as of June 13. This backlog highlights the ongoing challenges in the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>WHO Assistance</h2>\n<p>On the same day, <strong>June 13</strong>, two trucks carrying <strong>42 pallets of antibiotics</strong> were transferred to Gaza. These supplies were generously donated by the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong>. Since the beginning of the war, over <strong>24,000 tons</strong> of medical supplies and equipment, including anesthetics, insulin, and antibiotics, have entered Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Pauses</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead to today, <strong>June 14</strong>, the IDF has announced a temporary pause in operations in the <em>El Tahrir neighborhood</em> in Khan Yunis. This pause will occur between <strong>10:00 and 14:00</strong> and aims to facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid into the region.</p>\n",
