        "rendered": "\n<p>IDF soldiers discovered several tunnel shafts leading to an extensive 500-meter-long tunnel route that runs near an UNRWA school. This discovery adds to mounting evidence that UNRWA facilities are not merely caught up in conflict but are part of a strategic framework used by terrorist organizations like Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Proximity to Terrorist Infrastructure</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The proximity of this tunnel network to an UNRWA school in Rafah raises serious concerns about the agency\u2019s role and the security risks it poses to civilians. Terrorists often embed their infrastructure close to or within civilian sites to use them as shields, complicating military operations and exploiting the protection associated with humanitarian facilities. This tactic effectively turns UNRWA sites into extensions of military operations, providing strategic advantages for groups such as Hamas and exposing civilians to significant danger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDF soldiers, including those from the 931st Battalion, conducted thorough searches in the area, locating and eliminating nine rocket launchers. These launchers were part of a broader strategy by terrorist groups to launch attacks while shielded by civilian environments. The 500-meter tunnel route found near the school underscores how deeply embedded these networks are in areas associated with UNRWA, further illustrating how such organizations\u2019 facilities can be leveraged to support terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18626\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597-300x169.jpg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597-768x432.jpg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Role Under Scrutiny</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While UNRWA maintains a public image of neutrality and humanitarian assistance, repeated incidents involving tunnel networks, weapons caches, and operational cells near or within its facilities challenge this narrative. Whether through deliberate action or negligence, UNRWA&#8217;s infrastructure continues to be used to support and conceal militant operations. This pattern raises critical questions about the oversight of international aid organizations and their accountability in conflict zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of a tunnel route close to an UNRWA school highlights the ongoing issue of terrorist organizations embedding themselves within or near civilian infrastructure. This poses serious implications for the safety of civilians and the credibility of aid organizations. The international community must take decisive steps to ensure that facilities intended for humanitarian purposes are not misused to shield terrorist operations and to hold responsible parties accountable for their roles in enabling such activities.</p>\n",
