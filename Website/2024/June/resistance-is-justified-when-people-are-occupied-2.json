        "rendered": "\n<p>When pro-Palestinian and Hamas supporters say &#8220;Resistance Is Justified When People Are Occupied,&#8221; they assert that violent actions, including terrorism, against Israel are legitimate. This slogan is seen as a direct call for the complete destruction of the state of Israel and supports violent actions such as the October 7, 2023 massacre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, thousands of Hamas militants and Palestinian civilians, particularly teenagers and young adults aged 8-30, breached the fence separating Gaza&#8217;s terror bases from Israeli civilian areas. They attacked kibbutzim near the border, an area known in Israel as the Gaza Envelope. This tragic event is considered a massacre, highlighting the extreme violence and brutality involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas, designated as a terrorist organization by many countries, including the United States and the European Union, uses the justification of &#8220;resistance&#8221; for their acts of terrorism, which include rocket attacks and other violent actions against Israel. They claim their resistance is a legitimate response to what they perceive as Israeli occupation and oppression of Palestinians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the existence of a recognized state of Palestine is a subject of international debate, many assert that Palestine has never existed as a sovereign state. From this perspective, the term &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; refers to people living in the region known historically as Palestine, despite the absence of a formal state. Israel, therefore, is seen by many as defending its sovereign territory against groups that seek its destruction. The chant &#8220;Resistance Is Justified When People Are Occupied&#8221; by pro-Palestinian groups and Hamas supporters is therefore seen as advocating for the eradication of Israel and endorsing violent acts such as those seen in the October 7, 2023 massacre.</p>\n",
