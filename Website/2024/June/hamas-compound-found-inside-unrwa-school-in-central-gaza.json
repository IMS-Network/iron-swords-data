        "rendered": "\n<p>A precision strike by an Israeli Air Force (IAF) UAV, following intelligence provided by the IDF and ISA, has exposed yet another shocking example of UNRWA&#8217;s complicity in supporting Hamas operations. The targeted strike in central Gaza successfully neutralized a Hamas compound embedded within the UNRWA-operated &#8220;Abu Alhilu&#8221; school in Bureij. This compound was used as a base for planning and launching attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops. The operation was carried out using precision munitions, ensuring that civilian harm was minimized\u2014a testament to Israel\u2019s commitment to protecting innocents even when terrorists embed themselves in civilian spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Role as a Strategic Asset for Hamas</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of a fully operational Hamas compound within an UNRWA school is further proof that UNRWA facilities are not simply co-opted but are integral to Hamas\u2019s military strategy. This incident underscores UNRWA\u2019s failure to maintain neutrality and its role in facilitating, either knowingly or negligently, the operations of a designated terrorist organization. The compound served as a planning and operational hub from which numerous attacks were coordinated, placing Israeli and Palestinian civilians alike in danger.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Continuing Operations Against Terror Infrastructure</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond this pivotal strike, IDF forces are advancing targeted, intelligence-led operations throughout Gaza. The 162nd Division has been active in Rafah, uncovering terror tunnel shafts and seizing weapons including RPGs, ammunition, AK-47 rifles, explosive barrels, and various other military supplies. These findings highlight the extensive reach of Hamas&#8217;s network and its reliance on hidden infrastructure to support its campaigns of violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In central Gaza, the 99th Division\u2019s operations have dismantled numerous terror sites, confirming the region&#8217;s strategic importance for Hamas. The 2nd Brigade has reported significant seizures of weaponry and military equipment, reaffirming that Gaza remains a hotspot for terrorist planning and armament storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Strike on Military Structure in Which Hamas Terrorists Were Operating Within an UNRWA School\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0_mGwk9QJA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA Facilities: Hubs for Weapon Storage and Military Planning</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of the &#8220;Abu Alhilu&#8221; school as a base for weapons and operations demonstrates a disturbing trend. UNRWA facilities, widely funded and supported by international aid, have repeatedly surfaced as key assets in Hamas\u2019s strategy. This pattern of abuse shows that UNRWA, whether through gross negligence or active complicity, continues to play a role in facilitating terrorism. By embedding their activities in civilian spaces such as schools, Hamas not only endangers civilians but cynically manipulates the humanitarian cover provided by organizations like UNRWA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Israeli Naval forces and the IAF struck approximately 65 additional terror targets, including weapon depots, launch sites, and command posts over the past day, the reality becomes clearer: UNRWA\u2019s facilities are more than neutral sites\u2014they are critical components in the infrastructure of terror. The global community must acknowledge this fact and reassess how aid organizations operate in conflict zones to ensure that humanitarian resources are not weaponized against their intended purpose of peace and stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The embedding of a Hamas compound within an UNRWA school highlights an alarming breach of trust and illustrates that UNRWA\u2019s role goes beyond passive facilitation. This pattern of hosting or failing to prevent the use of its facilities for terrorism demands immediate international scrutiny and action. It is imperative that UNRWA be held accountable for its actions or inactions that contribute to violence, and that measures are taken to prevent such exploitation in the future.</p>\n",
