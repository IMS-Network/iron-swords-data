        "rendered": "\n<p>In a targeted operation guided by IDF intelligence and the ISA, Israeli Air Force (IAF) fighter jets struck a significant Hamas compound embedded within an UNRWA school in Nuseirat. This compound was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives, specifically members of the Nukhba Forces, who were responsible for the brutal attacks on southern Israeli communities on October 7th. The strike successfully neutralized several terrorists who were actively planning imminent assaults on IDF troops.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploitation of UNRWA Facilities for Terrorism</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident is yet another damning revelation of how UNRWA facilities are used by terrorist organizations not just as cover but as strategic operational hubs. Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives exploited the school as a shelter from which they coordinated their terrorist activities. The use of an educational facility as a command post not only endangers the lives of students and local civilians but also starkly illustrates how deeply UNRWA&#8217;s infrastructure is embedded within Hamas\u2019s military operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Preemptive Measures to Protect Civilians</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In keeping with its commitment to minimize civilian harm, the IDF undertook several precautionary measures before the strike, including extensive aerial surveillance and intelligence assessments. These steps aimed to reduce the risk to uninvolved civilians while ensuring that terrorists using the school as a shield were targeted and eliminated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Repeated Role in Terror Support</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The repeated discovery of terrorist compounds within UNRWA-operated schools sheds light on the organization\u2019s complicity, whether through negligence or active facilitation. These incidents show that UNRWA facilities are used as protective barriers for militants, undermining their stated mission as a humanitarian organization. The use of international aid resources to protect and enable terrorist activities is a clear violation of the trust placed in these institutions by the global community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The targeted strike on the Hamas compound within an UNRWA school in Nuseirat underscores a troubling and consistent pattern: UNRWA facilities are more than humanitarian centers; they are exploited as sanctuaries for terrorist planning and operations. This complicit relationship between UNRWA and terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad must be scrutinized, and measures must be taken to prevent further misuse of these facilities, ensuring they do not continue to facilitate violence under the guise of humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"18613\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/c450300e-fdff-4fc4-93c5-9434c42938fd-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18613\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/c450300e-fdff-4fc4-93c5-9434c42938fd-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/c450300e-fdff-4fc4-93c5-9434c42938fd-300x169.jpg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/c450300e-fdff-4fc4-93c5-9434c42938fd-768x432.jpg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/c450300e-fdff-4fc4-93c5-9434c42938fd-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/c450300e-fdff-4fc4-93c5-9434c42938fd.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-id=\"18614\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5391bfa7-e171-45d1-8f9a-3dc11044e67f-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18614\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5391bfa7-e171-45d1-8f9a-3dc11044e67f-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5391bfa7-e171-45d1-8f9a-3dc11044e67f-300x169.jpg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5391bfa7-e171-45d1-8f9a-3dc11044e67f-768x432.jpg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5391bfa7-e171-45d1-8f9a-3dc11044e67f-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5391bfa7-e171-45d1-8f9a-3dc11044e67f.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n",
