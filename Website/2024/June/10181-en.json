This defense provides a lot of security for the citizens and for the IDF, but we are not satisfied with that. We have many more forces in the IDF that are involved in attacking Hezbollah. And even today, we have already eliminated several operatives, and yesterday Hezbollah released a video showcasing a capability that we are familiar with, and we are preparing and building solutions to deal with such capabilities and other capabilities that will, in due time, meet their realization when necessary. Of course, we possess much stronger capabilities that I believe the enemy knows only a fraction of, and they will encounter them when needed at the right time. And remember, our test is to see that today we are defending, tomorrow we are winning, the day after tomorrow we are bringing the residents back to a much safer reality, and afterwards we will also build and restore with them, making this beautiful area stronger than it was before the war. A very great appreciation to you, continue to do excellent work. Thank you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>https://www.idf.il/209971</p>\n",
