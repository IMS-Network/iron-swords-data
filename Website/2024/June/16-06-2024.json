Only 92 trucks were collected by UN aid agencies throughout the day. The content of 1,000 aid trucks is still waiting to be collected from the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom (June 16).</p>\n<h2>Tactical Pause for Humanitarian Purposes</h2>\n<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to increase the volumes of humanitarian aid entering Gaza and following additional related discussions with the UN and international organizations, starting yesterday (Saturday), a local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes will take place from 08:00 until 19:00 every day until further notice. This pause will specifically cover the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom Crossing to the Salah al-Din Road and then northwards.</p>\n<h2>Ongoing Efforts by IDF and COGAT</h2>\n<p>This is an additional step in the humanitarian aid efforts that have been conducted by the IDF and COGAT since the beginning of the war. Today (June 16), between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Al-Batishi neighborhood in Khan Younis to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
