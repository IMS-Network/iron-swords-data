Captain Wasim Mahmoud, a deputy company commander, and seven of his soldiers fell early this morning during an attack on Tel Sultan. In the early morning hours, with the completion of the attack on the northwestern part of the neighborhood, infantry, armor, and engineering forces from the 401st Brigade entered in armored combat vehicle convoys to establish contact lines. According to our current information, an explosion occurred in one of the engineering vehicles in the convoy, likely caused by an explosive device placed in the area or by anti-tank missile fire. The eight soldiers killed were inside the armored vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Investigation and Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investigation and Support</strong>: Due to this severe incident, a team of experts from the Ministry of Defense and the IDF is examining the armored vehicle and all details of the event until we reach conclusions. IDF representatives delivered the tragic news to the families and are with them in this difficult time. After the official notifications to the bereaved families are completed, we will allow the release of the names of the additional fallen soldiers. We are aware that some entities on social networks are publishing names before the official approval of the IDF spokesperson. I ask you in these difficult hours to respect the fallen and not spread names until an official announcement is made. Please honor the bereaved families. Our primary commitment in the IDF is to them, and we will not deviate from this principle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ongoing Military Operations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ongoing Military Operations</strong>: IDF forces are focused on defeating Hamas&#8217;s military wing, specifically dismantling the Rafah Brigade&#8217;s capabilities. The forces on the ground are killing many terrorists every day, destroying weapons, launchers, and rockets, thereby preventing Hamas from operating against Israeli citizens as they did on October 7. Today, we received another painful reminder of the cost of war and the brave soldiers who are willing to sacrifice their lives for the State of Israel, our common home for Jews, Druze, Bedouins, Muslims, and Christians\u2014all Israeli citizens. Our hearts and thoughts are with the families during this difficult time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recent Operations and Challenges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recent Operations and Challenges</strong>: Last week, the IDF, Shin Bet, and Yamam carried out Operation Arnon, successfully bringing home Noa, Shlomi, Andrei, and Almog. We also remember the 120 hostages still held. Despite this significant achievement, we must honestly say that we cannot bring everyone home in this manner. We will continue to act in all ways to create conditions for the quick return of all hostages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Address to Northern Residents</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Address to Northern Residents</strong>: I want to address the residents of the north. On the northern border, we are engaged in defensive and offensive combat, with our primary challenge being the safe return of northern residents to their homes. This week, we eliminated a senior Hezbollah commander, Sami Talah, who was responsible for numerous terror plots and attacks on Israeli citizens, including the Shavuot Eve attack on Kfar Blum. He posed a significant threat to northern residents, so we eliminated him. This precise strike demonstrates our determination to create a different security reality in the north, allowing residents to return home safely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Response to Threats and Fires</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Response to Threats and Fires</strong>: In response to the elimination, Hezbollah launched rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles. Most threats were intercepted, but the defense is not airtight. We constantly strive to improve it. Due to some of the rocket fire, fires broke out in several locations. Fire and rescue forces, in cooperation with the IDF, immediately reach all areas to control the fires and prevent danger to lives. Many residents were evacuated from their homes, and many more are paying a heavy price in their daily lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resilience and Determination</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resilience and Determination</strong>: Residents of the north, I know that despite the unbearable reality you are experiencing, you demonstrate exceptional resilience and fortitude. Your resilience strengthens all the fighters on the northern border, including many reservists who work day and night in defense and attack. We are constantly assessing the situation and making decisions with consideration and responsibility. We are determined and ready to do whatever it takes to change the security reality in the north and will not allow a return to the pre-October 7 situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions from the Press</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Questions from the Press</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Liran Hug Nove, Kan 11</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Question</strong>: According to your estimates, the IDF is expected to complete the ground maneuver in Rafah in about two weeks. Has a decision been made regarding the continuation of the fighting in Gaza and the northern front? Additionally, could it be that Hamas targeted the armored vehicle this morning because it is an advanced combat vehicle?\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Answer</strong>: Regarding the armored vehicle, it is not an APC but an advanced armored vehicle called &#8220;Namera.&#8221; It is a result of our lessons learned, equipped with better protection and proving itself in combat. We entered the street with several vehicles, not just this one. We will learn the entire operational event, what exactly triggered the explosion in the armored vehicle, causing the soldiers&#8217; deaths, and we will share the details with the public and families.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rish News, Channel 12</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Question</strong>: This is the third disaster involving an armored vehicle in this war. Is there a better way to protect the soldiers and avoid this? And another question about the announcement: After the hostage rescue, the Prime Minister made a special announcement from the hospital shortly after their release. Tonight, after the disaster, only you are here, and the Prime Minister issued a recorded statement a few minutes ago. How is the decision made about when the Prime Minister speaks and when it is you?\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Answer</strong>: First, I will address the question about the armored vehicles. We have learned many lessons from Operation Protective Edge, and the IDF has built itself with protected armored vehicles. This enables all IDF soldiers to move in the last eight months. Regarding your question about when I speak, I speak when it is necessary and relevant. I am the IDF spokesperson, and that is my role. When there is an event of this magnitude with soldiers killed, I must speak and explain it to the public. Thank you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>4o</p>\n",
