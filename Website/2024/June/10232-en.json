This is reflected in both the number of terrorists killed and the destroyed infrastructure underground, in its mapping, its destruction, and the progress made in the underground fighting, which is very complex. The very fact that the 162nd Division now controls the Philadelphi route from the sea to the triangle of the borders between Israel, Gaza, and Egypt is extremely significant for closing the oxygen supply line of Hamas for future smuggling, and we are currently addressing the underground assets. We are definitely approaching the point where we say we have dismantled the Rafah Brigade; it is defeated not in the sense that there are no more terrorists, but in the sense that it cannot operate as a combat unit, it has many casualties, and you will ensure that until the mission is complete here, we will kill as many terrorists as possible and destroy as much infrastructure as we can going forward. A lot of appreciation; what is happening here is very impressive professionally, keep it up.&#8221;</p>\n",
