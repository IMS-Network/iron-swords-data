You have nearby communities, you have a city close by, with a tremendous responsibility to defend in the border area, to maintain a very stable security zone, so that the enemy does not enter, so that they do not cross it, so that they do not approach the fence. It is important to know that when there is an infiltration attempt, we must respond quickly, respond decisively, respond professionally, to not allow the enemy to infiltrate, and to provide the residents here with a great deal of security. The IDF needs more fighters today; we want you to see that one can be an ultra-Orthodox fighter. You can both learn and protect the security of the state. Continue doing good, both to protect the residents here and to be pioneers, ultra-Orthodox fighters, each in their own way of defining themselves. We will strengthen the battalion and show that you are doing more every period, growing stronger and proving that this is the right path.&#8221;</p>\n",
