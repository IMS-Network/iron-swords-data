Hamas terrorists brutally raped, tortured, and murdered Israeli civilians, taking over 100 hostages into their tunnel networks in Gaza. Rather than condemning these horrific acts of terrorism, Grim has provided a platform to amplify the voices of Hamas leaders, allowing them to share their narrative without fully denouncing their crimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grim\u2019s reporting fails to acknowledge the full extent of Hamas\u2019s atrocities, and by giving them a stage to justify their actions, he is effectively supporting their campaign of violence. His refusal to condemn the brutal rape, torture, and murder of Israeli civilians is not just irresponsible journalism\u2014it\u2019s tacit support for terrorism. By standing behind the words of Hamas leaders and refusing to acknowledge the reality of the massacre, Grim sends a clear message: he aligns himself with their actions and the goals of their terrorist campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In doing so, Grim not only fails to hold these terrorists accountable, but his reporting contributes to the spread of dangerous narratives that embolden Hamas and other terrorist organizations. His platform legitimizes the massacre and downplays the suffering of innocent Israeli civilians.</p>\n",
