        "rendered": "\n<p>The UN recently declared, &#8220;Civilians are not a target,&#8221; yet their actions and statements often fail to reflect this principle, especially when it comes to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terrorism. Since October 8, 2023, Hezbollah has launched thousands of rockets indiscriminately targeting Israeli civilians, turning Israel\u2019s northern region into a war zone. Innocent families have been forced into bomb shelters, lives have been lost, and entire communities displaced\u2014yet the UN remains silent on Hezbollah\u2019s flagrant disregard for civilian lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of condemning Hezbollah, the UN continues to issue statements that cast doubt on Israel\u2019s defensive measures, suggesting an equivalency between a democratic nation protecting its citizens and a terror organization hiding behind civilians. Most recently, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, rather than addressing Hezbollah\u2019s use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes or its indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians, chose to comment that \u201ccivilian objects should not be weaponized.\u201d This selective outrage highlights the UN\u2019s failure to call out the real perpetrators and its tendency to shield terrorist organizations from accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the UN truly believes that civilians are not a target, then where is the condemnation of Hezbollah\u2019s war crimes? Where is the outcry against the use of Lebanese civilians as human shields for terrorist operations? By refusing to confront these realities, the UN is not upholding its own principles but enabling the very organizations that use civilians as pawns in their war against Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hypocrisy in the UN\u2019s approach becomes even clearer when they remain silent on Hezbollah\u2019s terror but are quick to criticize Israel, a nation defending its people from relentless attacks. This double standard not only undermines Israel\u2019s security but emboldens terror groups like Hezbollah, sending a dangerous message: that targeting Israeli civilians is tolerated on the world stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time for the UN to truly stand for peace by addressing the root cause of the violence\u2014Hezbollah\u2019s terrorism\u2014and holding them accountable for their war crimes. Only then can there be hope for lasting peace and safety for all civilians in the region.</p>\n",
