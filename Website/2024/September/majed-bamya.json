The PLO, despite its efforts to position itself as a diplomatic entity advocating for Palestinian statehood, has an undeniable history rooted in terrorism, including the infamous 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and numerous attacks on Israeli civilians throughout the 1970s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bamya&#8217;s alignment with the PLO cannot be overlooked. As a diplomat who promotes Palestinian rights and often critiques Israel, he is directly supporting an organization with a long legacy of violent actions. The PLO has been responsible for the deaths of countless civilians through hijackings, bombings, and coordinated attacks, including targeting schoolchildren and families. These terrorist acts are not distant history but are ingrained in the organization&#8217;s identity and methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Bamya advocates for Palestinian statehood and often uses his platform to push peace narratives, his representation of the PLO ties him to a broader agenda that includes defending or legitimizing the violent actions of the past. His position places him in the sphere of those who, instead of solely promoting peaceful solutions, tacitly align with an organization that has perpetuated terror for decades. The Munich massacre, the school bus attacks, and other atrocities are part of the legacy he is supporting on the global stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Majed Bamya\u2019s outward rhetoric may focus on accountability and the protection of children, but the reality is that supporting an organization like the PLO ultimately endorses a legacy of terror. His diplomatic efforts should be understood within this broader context: as part of a mission not just for peace, but one that is deeply intertwined with a history of terrorism. Those who follow or support him must acknowledge that his work is inextricably linked to an organization responsible for decades of violence against civilians.</p>\n",
