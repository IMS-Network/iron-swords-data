        "rendered": "\n<p>On September 17, 2024, a series of explosions involving pagers used by Hezbollah terrorists resulted in over 3,000 injuries, with 500 in critical condition, and nine confirmed deaths\u2014all of whom were Hezbollah operatives. Despite claims by Hezbollah supporters on social media calling this an &#8220;Israeli terrorist attack,&#8221; the reality is that no civilians were harmed. This event is the consequence of Hezbollah&#8217;s continued aggression and involvement in acts of terror that consistently put the region at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Closer Look at the Incident</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The explosions occurred as a result of tampered devices\u2014pagers used by Hezbollah terrorists, which detonated across multiple locations in Lebanon, including southern Beirut and the Beqaa Valley. Despite the narrative pushed by Hezbollah&#8217;s supporters on platforms like Twitter and other social media, it\u2019s important to highlight that these were not civilian casualties but Hezbollah terrorists. This incident starkly reveals the vulnerabilities in Hezbollah\u2019s communication methods, which they have used recklessly amidst their broader terror campaign against Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah\u2019s Continued Attacks on Israel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the October 7, 2023 massacre by Palestinians and Hamas, Hezbollah has launched over 7,500 rockets, anti-tank missiles, and explosive drones at Israeli civilian and military targets. Hezbollah\u2019s terrorism escalated on October 8, 2023, and has resulted in 1,258 documented attacks against Israel through June 21, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most notable recent attacks include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>September 12, 2024</strong>: Hezbollah launched 15 rockets into the Western Galilee region in northern Israel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 4, 2024</strong>: Hezbollah fired over 200 rockets and drones targeting Israeli military positions in retaliation for the killing of a senior commander.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>July 27, 2024</strong>: A Hezbollah rocket struck a football field in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. Despite Hezbollah\u2019s rare denial of responsibility, the attack\u2019s origin was clear.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who\u2019s Truly Endangering Civilians?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The tragic attack on Majdal Shams is just one example of Hezbollah\u2019s disregard for human life. While Hezbollah\u2019s supporters may claim that incidents like the September 17 pager explosions are acts of Israeli terrorism, Hezbollah&#8217;s history tells a different story. Their attacks are aimed at both military and civilian targets in Israel, and they have shown little regard for the innocent people in the crossfire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah\u2019s rockets, drones, and missiles consistently target civilian areas, putting innocent lives at risk. While the explosion of Hezbollah terrorists&#8217; devices in Lebanon is a significant event, it pales in comparison to the relentless threat Hezbollah poses to Israel&#8217;s civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Role of Social Media</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah&#8217;s supporters have taken to social media, rallying behind false claims and spreading misinformation. Among the accounts backing Hezbollah\u2019s actions and falsely labeling the explosions as an Israeli &#8220;terrorist attack&#8221; are <strong>Suppressed News</strong>, <strong>Sulaiman Ahmed</strong>, <strong>DrLoupis</strong>, <strong>Kahlissee</strong>, <strong>Resist_05</strong>, <strong>abierkhatib</strong>, <strong>RevistaMigala</strong>, <strong>adelacojab</strong>, <strong>fionalali</strong>, <strong>abcnews</strong>, and over 5,000 others. These platforms play a key role in spreading propaganda that distorts the truth and masks Hezbollah\u2019s terrorist actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Bigger Picture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah\u2019s ongoing aggression cannot be ignored. The September 17, 2024 explosions further underscore the reality that Hezbollah\u2019s terrorism is not only a threat to Israel but to the stability of the entire region. While Hezbollah\u2019s supporters may claim victimhood in incidents like this, the broader context reveals their consistent involvement in violence and their ongoing disregard for human life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">&#8220;The world hates a Jew who hits back. The world loves us only when we are to be pitied.&#8221; &#8211; \u2060Golda Meir</h5>\n",
