Both organizations, while framing their agendas as advocating for Palestinian rights, have extremist views that ultimately call for the destruction of Israel. <em>IfNotNow</em> explicitly rejects the concept of a Jewish state and regularly employs rhetoric that calls into question Israel&#8217;s right to exist. Meanwhile, <em>Jewish Voice for Peace</em> not only aligns with anti-Israel sentiments but has indirect links to funding sources and organizations connected to terrorism, including ties to Hamas and the Iranian IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), both of which aim to eradicate Israel through violent means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lieb\u2019s involvement with these groups, and his public speeches advocating for a ceasefire without condemning the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7, 2023, paints a picture of someone who aligns more with movements that tolerate or overlook terroristic violence. By not addressing the mass killings, kidnappings, and acts of terror carried out by Hamas\u2014groups internationally recognized as terrorist organizations\u2014Lieb\u2019s activism becomes problematic. His failure to explicitly denounce these attacks reflects a broader trend among some anti-Israel advocates to conflate legitimate Palestinian concerns with support for organizations whose sole purpose is to carry out terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who follow or endorse Matt Lieb must be aware of the dangerous ground they tread by supporting an individual who is aligned with groups that, through their actions, ideologies, and indirect funding channels, lend credibility and support to terror networks aimed at destroying Israel.</p>\n",
