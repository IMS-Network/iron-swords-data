Today we attacked 1,300 terrorist targets of Hizbullah throughout Lebanon, and we are still continuing these operations, focusing on Hezbollah&#8217;s arsenal of weapons. We attacked with cruise missiles reaching hundreds of kilometers and medium-range rockets that can reach up to 200 kilometers, hidden among civilian houses with the intention to target the citizens of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah&#8217;s Use of Civilians as Human Shields</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the pictures here, you can see how Hezbollah hides long-range rockets in the attic of civilian homes, such as the one in the village of Humi al-Tatta in southern Lebanon. These rockets can reach thousands of kilometers, launched from an opening in the roof towards Israel. Underneath the rockets, Lebanese families serve as human shields, highlighting the immediate and real threat posed to Israel&#8217;s citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exposing Hezbollah&#8217;s Tactics and the IDF&#8217;s Continued Operations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we exposed to the world the brutal method of Hizbullah, launching rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles to kill Israeli citizens while putting the people of Lebanon at risk. Throughout the day, the air force has attacked many of these weapons across Lebanon. In one instance, in the village of Reika, weapons were stored in a house, and the attack led to visible explosions, proving that Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a heavily armed combat zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Casualties and Home Front Command Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the reported casualties in Lebanon, many terrorists were killed today during the attacks. We will provide more detailed data following an assessment of the situation. As of now, there is no change in the directives from the Home Front Command, and updates will be provided as necessary. Your resilience and responsible conduct remain critical to preventing the enemy from achieving its goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Government Extends State of Emergency Nationwide</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonight, the government announced the extension of the state of emergency across the country, reinforcing the need for careful and responsible actions in all regions. We will provide updates on any changes to policies and explain them both on websites and live broadcasts. This is part of ensuring the safe return of northern residents to their homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Addressing Multi-Arena Threats</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been engaged in a multi-arena war for many months, with threats emerging from Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. The IDF is constantly monitoring these arenas, prepared to respond to any escalation. Further details regarding intelligence on these areas will not be disclosed at this time.</p>\n",
