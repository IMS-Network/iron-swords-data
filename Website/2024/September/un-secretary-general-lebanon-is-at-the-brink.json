        "rendered": "\n<p>UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 recent tweet once again highlights his disconnection from the realities on the ground. For 11 months, since the October 7 massacre, Hezbollah\u2014a terrorist organization operating out of Lebanon\u2014has been launching rockets, UAVs, and mortar shells at Israeli civilians. Innocent families have been living under the constant threat of attack, yet the UN Secretary-General remained silent throughout this relentless aggression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as soon as Israel launched <strong>Operation Northern Arrows</strong> in defense of its citizens, Guterres suddenly found his voice, condemning Israel\u2019s defensive actions while ignoring the ongoing terrorism from Hezbollah. It&#8217;s astonishing that it took Israeli action for him to &#8220;wake up&#8221; and realize there is a war on Israel\u2019s northern border. Where was this concern during months of unprovoked attacks on Israeli civilians?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guterres\u2019 tweet claiming that &#8220;Lebanon is at the brink&#8221; and warning that Lebanon could become &#8220;another Gaza&#8221; misses the point entirely. Hezbollah is the one dragging Lebanon to the edge, using Lebanese soil as a launchpad for terrorism. Instead of condemning Israel, which is defending its people, the UN should be calling out Hezbollah\u2019s war crimes and Iran\u2019s role in supplying and backing this terror group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Guterres consistently downplays or ignores Hezbollah\u2019s provocations while blaming Israel for defending its own civilians reveals a troubling bias. His failure to hold Hezbollah accountable emboldens terrorism and does nothing to protect the very civilians he claims to care about\u2014both in Lebanon and Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel, like any sovereign nation, has the right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks. The UN\u2019s selective outrage and inability to address the real aggressor\u2014Hezbollah\u2014only exacerbates the conflict and does nothing to secure peace. It&#8217;s time for the international community to recognize that Hezbollah is the one threatening regional stability, not Israel\u2019s efforts to protect its people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The situation in Gaza is a non-stop nightmare that threatens to take the entire region with it.<br><br>Lebanon is at the brink.<br><br>The people of Lebanon, the people of Israel and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.</p>&mdash; Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1838597723789873367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n",
