        "rendered": "\n<p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres&#8217; recent call for a ceasefire and his remarks on the situation in Lebanon show a deeply troubling bias. For 11 months, Hezbollah has been relentlessly bombing northern Israel, indiscriminately targeting civilians with rockets, missiles, and drones. Over 100,000 Israelis have been forced to flee their homes, yet Guterres and the UN remained completely silent during this period of terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Israel\u2019s repeated warnings to Hezbollah to stop its attacks, nothing was done to stop the aggression. Only after Israel launched <strong>Operation Northern Arrows</strong> to defend its civilians and restore peace to the north did the UN finally speak up\u2014condemning Israel rather than addressing the real cause of the conflict: Hezbollah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel isn\u2019t to blame here. Hezbollah, a recognized terrorist organization, bears full responsibility for this escalation. The IDF\u2019s defensive actions during Operation Northern Arrows have been fully in line with international humanitarian law, targeting only Hezbollah\u2019s terror infrastructure, including its leadership. Israel even eliminated one of the world\u2019s most wanted terrorists, Hassan Nasrallah, yet the UN still focuses its criticism on Israel, ignoring Hezbollah\u2019s 11-month campaign of terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UN\u2019s one-sided narrative, calling for a ceasefire only after Israel takes action to defend its citizens, ignores the fact that Hezbollah has been the sole aggressor in this conflict. For nearly a year, Hezbollah bombed Israeli civilians without consequence, and now the UN wants Israel to stop defending itself. This is not just unfair\u2014it\u2019s outrageous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the international community genuinely wants peace, it must place the blame where it belongs: squarely on Hezbollah. Israel has a right, and a duty, to defend its people from terrorist attacks. The UN\u2019s repeated condemnations of Israel while turning a blind eye to Hezbollah\u2019s crimes only embolden the terror organization to continue its attacks. True peace can only be achieved by holding Hezbollah fully accountable for its actions and ensuring that Israel\u2019s right to self-defense is respected.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">War in Lebanon could lead to further escalation involving outside powers.<br><br>I fully support the proposal for a temporary ceasefire\u2014allowing for the delivery of humanitarian relief &amp; paving the way for the resumption of serious negotiations for a durable peace across the Blue Line.\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/K2Cfzkkjy4\">pic.twitter.com/K2Cfzkkjy4</a></p>&mdash; Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1839799450396700957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 27, 2024</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n",
