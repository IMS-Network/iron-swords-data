Rather than condemning the violence and terrorism committed by these groups, Haiphong often frames Israel as the sole aggressor, portraying terrorist organizations as legitimate resistance movements. His refusal to acknowledge the brutal reality of groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which are officially recognized as terrorist organizations by the U.S. and other countries, signals his dangerous alignment with these violent entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haiphong\u2019s rhetoric consistently downplays the threats posed by Hezbollah and Hamas, while actively criticizing Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from terror attacks. He has even suggested that Israel could be destroyed by Iran and its regional allies, including Hezbollah, further proving his dangerous sympathies. His vocal support of these groups on platforms like Twitter and YouTube raises concerns that those who follow his ideology might also find themselves supporting terrorism, either directly or indirectly. His active involvement in promoting anti-Israel narratives not only legitimizes terrorist organizations but also poses a serious threat to efforts aimed at combating terrorism and maintaining peace in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haiphong\u2019s actions make it clear that he is more than just a critic of U.S. foreign policy or Israel; he is a direct sympathizer with terrorist organizations whose goals are to incite violence and destroy Israel.</p>\n",
