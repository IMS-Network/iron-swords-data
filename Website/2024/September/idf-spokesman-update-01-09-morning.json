Their memory is a blessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kidnapping and Discovery</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The victims were kidnapped alive on the morning of the seventh of October by the terrorist organization Hamas. Their bodies were found during the fighting in Rafah, in an underground tunnel about a kilometer from the tunnel from which we rescued Farhan Kedi a few days ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military Operations and Rescue Efforts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the understanding that there may be additional abductees in the area, our forces operated with heightened caution. We did not have information about the exact location of the abductees. Above ground, fierce fighting was ongoing, and our forces eliminated terrorists even during the battles that took place there yesterday. The forces are still operating in the field at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rescue Mission and Identification Process</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last night, IDF forces intervened, rescuing the victims from the tunnel and bringing them to the field. The State of Israel will continue the identification process, which is being carried out by medical officials and Unit 443 of the Israel Police. IDF representatives have already sent a message to the families.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Emotional Toll</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What their families are going through this morning shakes us all. This news is deeply disturbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What exactly is the connection between the event of Farhan&#8217;s release and the discovery of the bodies? Did they sleep with him in captivity and were murdered because the terrorists feared that the IDF was coming?<br><strong>A:</strong> The bodies of the abductees were found about a kilometer from the point where we rescued Farhan Kedi. At the moment, as far as I know, there is a direct connection between the events. We are investigating this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does the finding of the bodies sharpen the IDF&#8217;s recommendation to stop and go to a deal?<br><strong>A:</strong> The IDF presents its positions and its alternatives to the political echelon in closed rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where were the abductees whose bodies were found in the soot area? Were there other abductees who were murdered with the six abductees who were taken to other places?<br><strong>A:</strong> The abductees were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists. Beyond that, I do not know any other details. We are investigating everything and following all the confirmed details that come to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> How did information leak during the night before the families were notified?<br><strong>A:</strong> Every leak and every rumor on social networks is a serious matter, especially when it happens before the families are notified. We need to address this issue in depth to prevent such occurrences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why does the IDF still allow Hamas to operate through the introduction of a humanitarian cordon in the Strip? Were there any injuries in the rescue operation to recover the bodies?<br><strong>A:</strong> On Shabbat, the IDF operates according to the decisions of the political echelon. All decisions regarding humanitarian relief of one kind or another, or polio vaccinations, are decisions of the political echelon, and it is our job to implement them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategic Alternatives Presented</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of alternatives to the Philadelphia issue have been presented to the political level to allow room for decisions. The political level has decided, and we will implement it.</p>\n",
