        "rendered": "\n<p><strong>Ceasefire For The Kids</strong> is an anti-Israel campaign led by the <strong>Northern California Islamic Council (NCIC)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NCIC collaborates with a variety of Islamic organizations, including several with connections to <strong>ISNA</strong> (Islamic Society of North America) and <strong>MSA</strong> (Muslim Students Association). Notably, NCIC lists ISNA \u2013 West Zone as one of its members. Additionally, NCIC works with many mosques and Islamic organizations in Northern California that are part of larger networks which regularly engage with ISNA and MSA. Both ISNA and MSA have historical ties to the <strong>Muslim Brotherhood</strong>, an organization widely recognized for its associations with <strong>Hamas</strong> and the <strong>IRGC</strong> (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Hamas, which originated as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, has received financial and military support from the IRGC, reinforcing the interconnected relationships between these entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NCIC also handles donations for <strong>Taxpayers for Peace</strong>, the group behind both the <strong>Ceasefire For The Kids</strong> campaign and <strong>The Unity Lab</strong>, which are aligned with anti-Israel initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ceasefire For The Kids&#8221; is an anti-Israel campaign that appears to be aligned with efforts to manipulate public opinion and delegitimize the State of Israel. Such campaigns are often associated with organizations like Hamas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas engages in propaganda efforts to shape narratives around the Israeli-Hamas war, framing Israel as the aggressor.<br>These efforts are part of a broader strategy to isolate Israel internationally, undermine its legitimacy, and gain sympathy for Hamas and its causes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By promoting campaigns like &#8220;Ceasefire For The Kids,&#8221; groups linked to Hamas aim to generate international pressure on Israel, portraying themselves as defenders of Palestinian civilians, particularly children, while ignoring or justifying the use of violence against Israeli civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of narrative is a common tactic used by Hamas and its affiliates, which use humanitarian language to mask their own violent activities and shift blame onto Israel for the broader conflict.</p>\n",
