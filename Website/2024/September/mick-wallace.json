By downplaying their terrorism and focusing solely on vilifying Israel, Wallace has become a vocal supporter of these organizations.

His public platform promotes a dangerous narrative that supports the very groups responsible for countless attacks on Israel and its civilians. This kind of rhetoric not only sympathizes with terrorists but also encourages the spread of extremist ideologies that threaten peace and security.</p>\n",
