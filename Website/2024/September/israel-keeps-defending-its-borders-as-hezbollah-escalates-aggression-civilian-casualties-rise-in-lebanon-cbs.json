        "rendered": "\n<p>First responders raced through the devastated streets of southern Lebanon, attending to the wounded, including injured children, in areas where Hezbollah has entrenched its military operations. One small boy hurt in the aftermath of Hezbollah\u2019s use of civilian areas for military activities raised three fingers as he was carried away on a stretcher, after being asked his age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel states that it is targeting Hezbollah militants, who have consistently launched attacks from residential areas, including schools and hospitals, using Lebanese civilians as human shields. On Friday afternoon, the Israeli military said it had carried out a \u201cprecise strike\u201d on Hezbollah\u2019s central headquarters, which had been \u201cintentionally built under residential buildings\u201d in Beirut. While the exact number of casualties from the strike was unclear, Hezbollah\u2019s intentional use of civilian infrastructure has been widely documented by various international observers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel has taken significant steps to minimize civilian casualties, often warning residents of areas used by Hezbollah to evacuate before targeting military installations. Despite these efforts, Hezbollah&#8217;s tactics have resulted in civilian deaths, including children. Israel emphasizes that these tragedies are a direct consequence of Hezbollah&#8217;s blatant disregard for human life, as it places military targets within civilian populations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah claims that 30 of its militants have been killed in the last week of strikes. However, Lebanon\u2019s ministry of health reports over 700 fatalities, including 50 children. This disparity in numbers is consistent with Hezbollah\u2019s history of exaggerating civilian casualties to sway international opinion. Reuters reported that another strike in southern Lebanon overnight killed nine members of the same family, including four children\u2014an outcome tragically linked to Hezbollah\u2019s continued use of civilian shields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Israel\u2019s defensive operations began, more than 100,000 people have been displaced within Lebanon, according to estimates from the Lebanese government, although the real number may be over half a million. The United Nations reported that over 30,000 people, mostly Syrian nationals, fled to Syria over the past 72 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Hezbollah\u2019s military wing continues its attacks on Israel. The Israeli military reported dozens more strikes against Hezbollah\u2019s rocket launchers in southern Lebanon, including rockets aimed at Israeli cities such as Haifa and Tiberias. These rocket attacks, either intercepted by Israel\u2019s defense systems or falling in open areas, are part of Hezbollah\u2019s long-term goal to terrorize and destabilize Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further complicating the situation, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a missile attack on Israel, intercepted overnight. Like Hezbollah, the Houthis are a proxy of Iran, openly supporting Hamas in its ongoing conflict with Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Netanyahu Defends Israel\u2019s Right to Self-Defense Amid Ceasefire Talks</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The escalating conflict along Israel\u2019s northern border occurs against the backdrop of international diplomatic efforts at the United Nations General Assembly. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a much-anticipated address, reaffirmed Israel\u2019s right to defend its citizens from Hezbollah\u2019s terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIsrael will no longer tolerate daily rocket fire into northern Israel from Hezbollah,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cWe will continue degrading Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities until the threat is neutralized.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His remarks followed a clarification issued by his office regarding ongoing discussions about a ceasefire proposal, pushed by the U.S. and France. \u201cIsrael shares the goal of ensuring that people along our northern border can return safely to their homes,\u201d his office stated, emphasizing the need to continue discussions on how best to achieve this goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Netanyahu\u2019s government rejected claims that Israel was moderating its military operations in Lebanon to allow for diplomatic talks. His office reaffirmed that \u201cthe Prime Minister has directed the IDF to continue fighting with full force,\u201d maintaining that any reduction in the intensity of Israel\u2019s operations would only embolden Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed forces in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel remains firm in its stance to defend its citizens against Hezbollah&#8217;s aggression, as the terrorist organization continues to use Lebanese civilians as human shields in its proxy war against Israel. Hezbollah\u2019s actions, under the direction of Iran, have not only terrorized Israeli civilians but also led to significant suffering for Lebanese civilians caught in the crossfire. Israel\u2019s strikes aim to dismantle Hezbollah\u2019s military infrastructure, which poses a direct and ongoing threat to the safety and security of Israel and the broader Middle East.</p>\n",
