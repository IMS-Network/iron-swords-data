        "rendered": "\n<p>The recent call by Filippo Grandi of the UNHCR for a ceasefire and peace in Lebanon, amid escalating violence, underscores a significant imbalance in the international response to the ongoing conflict in the region. While any plea for peace is essential, the focus solely on Lebanon&#8217;s plight without acknowledging the root cause of this crisis\u2014Hezbollah&#8217;s unprovoked aggression against Israeli civilians\u2014demonstrates a troubling bias in the UN&#8217;s approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 11 months, Hezbollah has bombarded northern Israel, targeting 2 million civilians with relentless rocket fire. This persistent threat prompted the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to initiate Operation Northern Arrows to defend its citizens and facilitate the safe return of around 100,000 Israelis who had been displaced by these attacks. Remarkably, throughout this period, the UNHCR remained notably silent on the suffering of Israeli civilians, not offering any substantial acknowledgment or support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as Israel takes necessary and defensive measures to secure its northern border and protect its citizens, UNHCR&#8217;s sudden call for global action and support for Lebanon portrays an imbalanced perspective that appears to ignore the suffering endured by Israelis under constant threat from Hezbollah. This skewed narrative not only undermines the legitimacy of Israel&#8217;s defensive actions but also fails to hold Hezbollah accountable for its role as the aggressor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filippo Grandi&#8217;s comments, which seem to express unwarranted support for Lebanon in a manner that indirectly benefits Hezbollah, do not contribute to a resolution but rather perpetuate the conflict. By focusing predominantly on the consequences in Lebanon while neglecting the causative actions of Hezbollah from within Lebanese territory, the UNHCR is not fulfilling its role as a neutral humanitarian body effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True humanitarian support and calls for peace must be unbiased and inclusive of all victims affected by the conflict. The international community, guided by agencies like the UNHCR, must recognize and address the actions of Hezbollah that have endangered millions of lives, both in Lebanon and Israel. Only with a balanced approach that holds all parties accountable can we hope to achieve a durable peace that ensures the safety and well-being of all civilians in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lebanon on the brink: The escalating violence has created an urgent need for humanitarian support. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FilippoGrandi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FilippoGrandi</a> calls for a ceasefire and peace.
