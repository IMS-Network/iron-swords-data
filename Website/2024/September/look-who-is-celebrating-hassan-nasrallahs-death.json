The <strong>Islamic Republic of Iran</strong> has established a &#8220;ring of fire&#8221; around Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve certainly heard the news\u2014<strong>Hezbollah&#8217;s head, Hassan Nasrallah, is dead</strong>. It\u2019s not only the people of Israel who are relieved; in fact, many throughout the Arab world are celebrating. After news of Israel\u2019s Friday strike on Hezbollah\u2019s leader spread, <strong>parties erupted in the streets of cities in Syria</strong>. Music was played, sweets were handed out, and faces were smiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why are Arabs Celebrating?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are Arabs happy about an Israeli victory? People who don\u2019t know anything about the Middle East assume that Arabs and Israelis are enemies, but that\u2019s not true. <strong>Millions of Sunni Muslims in Syria</strong>, for example, hate Nasrallah, hate Hezbollah, and hate the <strong>Iranian overlords</strong> directing them. Over a million were slaughtered by them in recent years while <strong>Hezbollah helped Syria\u2019s bloody dictator, Assad, massacre his own people</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunni Muslims remember <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s assassination of Lebanon\u2019s prime minister Rafik Hariri in 2005</strong>. They also remember <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s slaughter of Palestinians in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria in 2015</strong>, and <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s starvation of babies in Madaya, Syria, in 2016</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignore what Western commentators are telling you\u2014listen to what the Arabs themselves have to say. Many in the Arab and Muslim world know that <strong>Hezbollah is a force for destruction</strong>. They know that Hezbollah is an <strong>Iranian boot on their neck</strong>. In fact, they have felt on their own skins the <strong>cruelty of the rapes, the massacres, the beheadings, and the torture in Syria</strong> carried out by Hezbollah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah&#8217;s True Nature</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah claims that its reason for existing is to be the <strong>defender of Lebanon</strong>, but many see through that claim. <strong>Israel</strong>, on its part, has no interest in occupying Lebanon at all. In fact, Israel <strong>waited for 11 whole months</strong> before retaliating to massive barrages of rockets into its sovereign territory\u2014something which no other country in the world would ever do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s remember: the week before Hamas and Hezbollah launched their wars in Israel on October 7th and 8th, <strong>global headlines were announcing that peace was coming to the Middle East</strong>. There was optimism in the air; there was talk of peace between Israel and the most important Arab state, <strong>the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, the <strong>Islamic Republic of Iran</strong> has been trying to destroy Israel from seven fronts using <strong>Arab proxies</strong>, firing from the rubble of <strong>Iranian-dominated Arab states like Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen</strong>. In recent weeks, with Hezbollah&#8217;s senior leadership eliminated and <strong>Hamas being broken in Gaza</strong>, there is a chance to <strong>pave the way to peace</strong>, but not before Israel makes absolutely sure that Hezbollah\u2014or what remains of it\u2014is removed from the <strong>Lebanese-Israeli border</strong> and is disarmed. In other words, Israel must make sure that the <strong>two UN resolutions</strong> pertaining to this issue from <strong>18 whole years ago</strong> are actually implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">President Biden&#8217;s Statement</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>President Biden</strong> released a statement after Nasrallah\u2019s death, saying that Israel\u2019s strike on Nasrallah was a <strong>measure of justice</strong> for his many victims, including <strong>thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians</strong>. And he\u2019s absolutely right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The war is not yet over. <strong>Hezbollah continues to attack Israelis right now</strong>. <strong>Hamas continues to hold hostages</strong> in its terror dungeons in Gaza. The <strong>Iranian regime</strong> continues to threaten Israelis with yet more attacks. With <strong>Hezbollah\u2019s leadership in disarray</strong>, now is the time to press the advantage. Now is the time to <strong>leverage Israel\u2019s tactical victories over Hezbollah</strong> to roll back the <strong>Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s regional hegemony</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All countries of the world must stand behind Israel and its <strong>Arab partners</strong> in the region as they beat back the <strong>Iranian regime</strong> and forge a new future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 1: Hezbollah Rockets and Israeli Home Front</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: There have been reports of <strong>Hezbollah rockets</strong> in Tiberias and Nazareth. How far can Hezbollah\u2019s rockets reach into Israel, and how is the Israeli home front preparing for such threats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: It\u2019s well known that <strong>Hezbollah</strong> had hundreds of thousands of rockets before the IDF attacked its storages, arsenals, and headquarters. Many of these rockets are very specific and long-range. This remains a threat not only to Israel but also to the <strong>Arab towns in Israel</strong> and the <strong>Palestinian Authority in the West Bank</strong>. Though we\u2019ve significantly cut back their supply, there\u2019s still much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 2: Will Israel Ever Go Directly After Iran?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Will Israel ever go directly after the <strong>Islamic Republic of Iran</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: That\u2019s a very good question, and I have no intention of answering it directly here. But I\u2019ll put it this way: everything we\u2019ve been speaking about since October 7th\u2014<strong>Gaza Strip, West Bank, Lebanon, Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq</strong>\u2014all of this traces back to one entity: the <strong>Islamic Republic of Iran</strong>. Yes, there are other evils like <strong>Qatar</strong>, which funds the Muslim Brotherhood, and <strong>Erdogan\u2019s Turkey</strong>, but if <strong>Iran\u2019s will to create a global Islamic caliphate</strong> is quelled, many of the region&#8217;s problems will also be quelled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 3: Can Lebanon Rid Itself of Hezbollah?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is there really a possibility that <strong>Lebanon</strong> can rid itself of Hezbollah after they\u2019ve been embedded in society and government since the 1970s?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: It\u2019s all a matter of the <strong>will of the Lebanese people</strong>. Lebanon was originally a sanctuary for Christians. Over time, they welcomed Muslims, who grew in number and became more aggressive, and in the 1970s, the Shiites came in, overtaking the country. Can Hezbollah be removed? <strong>Yes, it can</strong>. But it\u2019s not going to be easy. Much work has already been done, and there\u2019s still more to do, but ultimately, the fate of the Lebanese people is in their own hands, and the <strong>Lebanese army</strong> will need to take the reins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 4: Dahiya Area of Beirut Strike</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Can you explain what the <strong>Dahiya area</strong> of Beirut is, following today\u2019s IDF strike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: <strong>Hezbollah</strong> embeds itself among the civilian population in <strong>Dahiya</strong>, a neighborhood in Beirut that has become their headquarters. <strong>Hezbollah uses homes, schools, hospitals</strong>\u2014embedding their terror cells among civilians. This is similar to <strong>Hamas</strong> in Gaza, using the population as human shields. It\u2019s the standard operating procedure for <strong>radical Islamist terrorist organizations</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 5: Egypt\u2019s Loss of Revenue</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What has caused <strong>Egypt</strong> to lose $6 billion in revenue from the <strong>Suez Canal</strong>, and what can be done about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Instability in the region, along with <strong>Iran-backed Houthi fighters</strong> targeting shipments, has significantly impacted Egypt\u2019s income. <strong>Egypt</strong> is a 100-million-person republic, already facing economic challenges. The war has also harmed <strong>tourism</strong>. Red lines must be drawn to address the <strong>Houthis</strong> and stabilize the region. The root of the issue again leads back to the <strong>Islamic Republic of Iran</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Question: Message to the People of Lebanon</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is your message to the people of <strong>Lebanon</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Israel is <strong>not at war with the Lebanese people</strong>. We never were, and we never will be. There\u2019s no ill feeling among Israelis toward civilians in Lebanon. In fact, we <strong>crave and dream of peace</strong> with the Lebanese people. We do not want to see <strong>Radwan forces</strong>, Hezbollah&#8217;s commando force, raping and massacring civilians, as they plan to do with our civilians in the north. We cannot accept unprovoked rocket attacks. Israel acted not only for its own people but for the <strong>region in general</strong>. Hopefully, in the future, we can exchange warm words and look forward to peace.</p>\n",
