By supporting the October 7 massacre, where Hamas and thousands of Palestinians brutally murdered, tortured, and kidnapped Israeli civilians, Christensen supports the actions of these groups. The massacre, which involved over 10,300 rockets fired into Israel and widespread attacks on civilian communities, left 1,139 people dead, including 695 Israeli civilians, and hundreds taken hostage into Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guy\u2019s refusal to acknowledge these atrocities, along with his vocal criticism of Israel, positions him as a sympathizer of terrorist organizations. Additionally, his support extends to Hezbollah, another recognized terrorist group that has been launching rockets, UAVs, and suicide drones from northern Israel since October 8, displacing over 100,000 Israelis and endangering millions of civilians. Hezbollah\u2019s indiscriminate attacks on Israeli towns and cities further escalate violence and terror in the region, yet Guy continues to use his platform to spread anti-Israel narratives without addressing the reality of terrorism in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
