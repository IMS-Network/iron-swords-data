        "rendered": "\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has led the Lebanese militant group for the past three decades, transforming it into one of the most powerful paramilitary groups in the Middle East.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revision:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has led the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah for the past three decades, which has consistently targeted Israeli civilians and conducted global terrorism. Hezbollah, designated as a terrorist organization by multiple nations, is a key player in Iran&#8217;s regional destabilization efforts. Its militant activities, particularly against Israel, have inflicted terror and violence on civilian populations across the Middle East.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Original Paragraph:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Under the leadership of the 64-year-old Nasrallah, Hezbollah has fought wars against Israel and taken part in the conflict in neighboring Syria, helping tip the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revision:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the leadership of 64-year-old Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah has initiated multiple wars against Israel, indiscriminately targeting civilians with rockets and attacks. Its involvement in the Syrian civil war, supporting the brutal Assad regime, has contributed to countless civilian deaths and human rights violations. Hezbollah&#8217;s military actions have extended far beyond Lebanon, solidifying its role as a tool of Iran&#8217;s broader strategy to spread extremism and suppress opposition in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Original Paragraph:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;An astute strategist, Nasrallah reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with Shiite religious leaders in Iran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revision:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nasrallah has used Hezbollah as a proxy for Iran, conducting terrorist attacks not only against Israel but also against other Western targets worldwide. His alliance with other Iranian-backed groups, including Hamas, has intensified the threats to Israeli civilians. Hezbollah\u2019s role in the Axis of Resistance extends Iran\u2019s reach, empowering terrorism in the region, notably aiming to destroy Israel through unrelenting violence and promoting instability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Original Paragraph:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah holds the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric\u2019s lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revision:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While Nasrallah may be revered by Hezbollah&#8217;s Shiite base in Lebanon, his leadership has brought suffering to both Lebanese and Syrian civilians. His use of the title <em>sayyid</em> and fiery rhetoric often cloaks his role in promoting terrorism and violence under a guise of religious duty, diverting attention from the suffering caused by Hezbollah&#8217;s actions, both to Israelis and the Lebanese people forced into Hezbollah&#8217;s conflicts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Original Paragraph:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Revision:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah was designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in 1997 due to its role in numerous attacks against civilians, including the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings that killed 241 American service members. Other countries, including Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Arab League, have also designated Hezbollah as a terrorist entity due to its global network of violence and terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Points to Add:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Nasrallah&#8217;s Role in Global Terrorism</strong>: Nasrallah has overseen Hezbollah\u2019s global terror operations, including attacks on Jewish and Israeli targets, such as the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hezbollah\u2019s Hostilities Against Israel</strong>: Hezbollah continues to pose a grave threat to Israeli civilians, launching thousands of rockets at Israel in recent conflicts. Hezbollah\u2019s vast arsenal of Iranian-supplied weapons endangers both Israeli and Lebanese civilians.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nasrallah\u2019s Allegiance to Iran</strong>: Nasrallah is widely recognized as Iran\u2019s key proxy in Lebanon, with Hezbollah serving as the most powerful non-state actor in the region, advancing Iran\u2019s agenda by threatening regional stability through violence, especially against Israel.</li>\n</ol>\n",
