        "rendered": "\n<p>Lebanon is indeed hosting one of the highest numbers of refugees per capita globally. But it\u2019s crucial to understand what has brought the country to this point of crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This disaster is not just the result of unfortunate circumstances\u2014it is directly tied to <strong>Hezbollah&#8217;s aggressive actions</strong>. Since <strong>October 8, 2023</strong>, Hezbollah launched attacks on <strong>Israeli civilians</strong> from southern Lebanon, drawing the country into a destructive conflict. Hezbollah, heavily backed by <strong>Iran&#8217;s IRGC</strong>, has not only endangered Lebanese civilians but has <strong>escalated tensions and instability</strong> across the region, causing massive displacement and civilian casualties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than <strong>211,000 people have been displaced</strong>, and <strong>1,540 civilians have been killed</strong> in this new wave of violence. Refugees who sought safety are now being displaced again due to Hezbollah\u2019s militarization of southern Lebanon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world must hold <strong>Hezbollah and its Iranian backers</strong> accountable for this humanitarian catastrophe. This is not just about providing aid but also addressing the <strong>root cause of the crisis</strong>: the <strong>terrorist actions of Hezbollah</strong>, which continues to use Lebanese civilians as human shields and worsen the plight of refugees. Any response that ignores this truth only serves to embolden the aggressors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lebanon deserves peace</strong>\u2014and that peace begins with dismantling Hezbollah\u2019s stranglehold on the country.</p>\n",
