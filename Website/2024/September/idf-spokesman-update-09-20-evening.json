Earlier today, the IDF carried out a precise operation targeting and eliminating the head of Hezbollah&#8217;s operations system, Sabotage in Rai Makil, along with key members of the Radwan force command structure. Akil and these commanders were responsible for orchestrating terrorist actions against Israeli civilians. These commanders, led by Akil, were central to Hezbollah&#8217;s plans for an attack on Israel&#8217;s northern territories. This plan, dubbed the &#8220;Conquer the Galilee&#8221; strategy, involved Hezbollah&#8217;s intention to infiltrate and occupy Israeli settlements in the Galilee, murdering and kidnapping civilians, similar to what Hamas did on October 7th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commanders targeted in today&#8217;s attack had been orchestrating assaults against Israel since October 8th, with further planned operations. Braim Makil, as the head of Hezbollah\u2019s operations team and commander of the Radwan unit, played a central role in these attacks. The Radwan unit, known as Hezbollah&#8217;s elite force, was under Akil&#8217;s direct command. He was responsible for several key terrorist acts, including the 2019 shooting at the Avivim outpost and the attack at the Megiddo junction, along with numerous infiltration attempts into Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akil, Is a terrorist with significant blood on his hands, was involved in attacks resulting in the deaths of many innocent civilians. He was also wanted by the United States, which had placed a bounty on him. The IDF remains in a state of high readiness, prepared for both offensive and defensive operations. Despite this escalation, there is currently no change in the Home Front Command\u2019s instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Broader Conflict and IDF Objectives</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF continues to fight on multiple fronts, with enemies constantly attempting to challenge Israel&#8217;s security. The IDF\u2019s primary goals are to dismantle Hamas and secure the release of all abductees in Gaza, while also restoring security in northern Israel to allow residents to safely return to their homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>News Question 13:</strong> <em>How does the elimination of key commanders affect the fighting in Gaza?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The elimination of these commanders, such as Akil, who planned daily rocket attacks against Israel, is a significant blow to Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities. The IDF remains focused on dismantling Hamas and securing the return of abductees from Gaza. As of now, there are no changes to the Home Front Command&#8217;s directives, and the IDF continues its determined efforts in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel is in a tense period, with recent attacks, including one from Yemen that was quickly neutralized. The possibility of additional attacks from northern fronts remains. The public will be promptly informed of any changes in the Home Front Command\u2019s directives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Israel Today Question:</strong> <em>With 200 launches a day, is there an intention to evacuate residents of the northern second line?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were indeed 200 launches today, a serious escalation. In response, the IDF targeted those responsible, including Ibrahim Makil and other senior commanders from the Radwan force. The IDF has been acting decisively, particularly in the past few months and days, to change this dangerous reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IDF&#8217;s Strategy</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF is conducting continuous situational assessments to ensure security for Israeli civilians. The ultimate goal, as set by the political leadership, is to safely return northern residents to their homes without escalating the conflict further. The IDF is focused on achieving these defined objectives without seeking a broader regional escalation.</p>\n",
