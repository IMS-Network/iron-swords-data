By consistently refusing to acknowledge the existence and brutality of Hamas, especially in the wake of the October 7 massacre, Stein has made it clear where her allegiances lie. On October 7th Hamas and thousands of Palestinians crossed into Israel, murdering civilians, torturing families, and taking hostages. Over 1,100 people were killed, and hundreds were kidnapped into Gaza\u2014yet Stein\u2019s focus remains on condemning Israel, while completely ignoring these acts of terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stein\u2019s failure to recognize or criticize Hamas\u2019s violence is a clear indication of her tacit support for the group. Instead of holding these terrorists accountable, she blames Israel for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, while remaining silent on the horrific actions that led to the conflict in the first place. Similarly, she refuses to acknowledge Hezbollah\u2019s ongoing attacks from northern Israel, where Hezbollah has displaced over 100,000 Israeli civilians through indiscriminate rocket fire, UAVs, and suicide drones. Hezbollah\u2019s attacks, which target both military and civilian infrastructure, have put millions of Israeli civilians in constant danger\u2014yet Stein continues to criticize Israel, ignoring the terrorism directed at innocent people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By standing with groups like Hamas and Hezbollah through her silence and one-sided rhetoric, Dr. Jill Stein is indirectly supporting their violent agenda. Anyone who aligns with her views risks being associated with sympathizers of terrorism. Her rhetoric, which exclusively blames Israel for the conflict, emboldens terrorist organizations and further fuels anti-Israel sentiment, making it clear that she supports narratives that lead to violence and terror against Israeli civilians.</p>\n",
