        "rendered": "\n<p>During an IDF operation on Saturday, footage emerged revealing terrorists positioned within UNRWA\u2019s central logistics compound, operating alongside UN vehicles. This event underscores UNRWA\u2019s role as more than just a neutral party and reinforces its position as an enabler and supporter of terrorist activities within Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA: Beyond Humanitarian Aid</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA has long claimed a mission of providing aid and support to Palestinian refugees, but repeated incidents reveal a far more sinister reality. This most recent operation confirms that UNRWA\u2019s facilities are not just being passively used; they are integrated into the operations of Hamas, facilitating and sheltering its operatives. The footage, which clearly shows armed terrorists near and within the vicinity of UNRWA\u2019s logistics compound\u2014a central hub for distributing aid\u2014proves that this organization\u2019s resources and infrastructure are leveraged to conduct and support acts of terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aiding and Abetting Terrorism</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The presence of armed operatives near UN vehicles and inside an UNRWA compound highlights the organization\u2019s complicity. Such proximity is not coincidental; it reflects a strategic overlap where UNRWA\u2019s logistics capabilities are knowingly or tacitly offered to Hamas to conduct its operations. This situation compromises the safety and legitimacy of humanitarian efforts and poses significant risks to both aid workers and the civilians they claim to protect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF, having identified and documented the activities, promptly communicated these findings to senior international officials via the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). COGAT representatives also issued a stern warning to the UN about the severe implications of harboring terrorists within UNRWA\u2019s logistics center, stressing the threat this poses to the organization\u2019s facilities and mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Pattern of Complicity</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not an isolated incident. Previous IDF reports have revealed weapons caches, tunnel networks, and command centers strategically placed within or under UNRWA facilities. Such repeated discoveries strip away the facade of neutrality that UNRWA attempts to maintain and expose a disturbing pattern where the organization actively facilitates terrorism. By allowing its facilities to become shields for Hamas, UNRWA not only undermines its stated humanitarian mission but endangers countless lives by embedding terror within civilian contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The international community can no longer overlook the evidence mounting against UNRWA. The footage from eastern Rafah, combined with past findings of weapons caches hidden in UNRWA-marked bags and tunnels beneath their facilities, demands action. UNRWA\u2019s cooperation or willful blindness to these activities makes it complicit in the violence perpetuated by Hamas. The UN must undertake an urgent investigation and enforce strict measures to ensure that its agencies are not weaponized for terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18592\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1024x576.png 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-300x169.png 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-768x432.png 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1536x864.png 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.png 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA\u2019s involvement with Hamas is undeniable and goes beyond passive complicity\u2014it is active participation. Its infrastructure, resources, and logistics have been used to shield and support terrorism, blurring the line between humanitarian aid and militant facilitation. The international community must hold UNRWA accountable, reassess its operations, and prevent further misuse of humanitarian channels that empower violence under the pretense of aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Terrorists Next to UN Vehicles at the UNRWA Logistics Compound in Eastern Rafah\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiCgUnRmtS4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
