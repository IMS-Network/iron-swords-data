        "rendered": "\n<p>Amid the ongoing IDF operations targeting terrorist infrastructure in Jabaliya, significant evidence has surfaced that underscores UNRWA&#8217;s role as more than a mere observer in the conflict. During recent activities, IDF troops discovered weaponry stored within an UNRWA facility\u2014once again revealing the organization\u2019s deep entanglement with terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad. This finding solidifies concerns that UNRWA facilities are not just passively exploited but actively support terrorist operations, providing crucial infrastructure and cover for violent activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Continued Complicity</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF\u2019s discovery of weaponry inside an UNRWA building underscores a troubling reality: these facilities, widely perceived as neutral and humanitarian in nature, are repeatedly linked to the operations of terrorist organizations. The identification of arms within a structure meant to serve as a sanctuary for aid reveals how UNRWA\u2019s resources are used to bolster Hamas&#8217;s and Islamic Jihad&#8217;s efforts against Israel. This discovery is not an isolated incident but part of a broader pattern indicating that UNRWA&#8217;s role extends beyond that of a passive party to one that facilitates terror under the guise of humanitarian assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aiding Attacks and Shielding Terrorist Operations</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident in Jabaliya highlights a concerning strategy where UNRWA&#8217;s infrastructure acts as a protective shield for terrorist activities. This practice of embedding weaponry and using such facilities to plan or execute attacks not only endangers civilians but jeopardizes the credibility of UNRWA as a humanitarian organization. The IDF, facing armed resistance in close-quarters combat, neutralized several terrorists during the operation and reported no injuries among Israeli troops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complementing this ground effort, an IAF aircraft successfully eliminated operatives who had launched anti-tank missiles at IDF forces. The aerial capabilities were further demonstrated as an Islamic Jihad tactical-level commander, along with three other operatives, was taken out in an airstrike in eastern Rafah. This proactive defense by the IDF aims to dismantle both the infrastructure and leadership of groups using UNRWA facilities to shield their operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF&#8217;s efforts in central Gaza have also seen tank strikes that neutralized terrorists and obliterated military structures where explosives and weapons were hidden. Over the past 24 hours, the IAF conducted strikes on approximately 80 terrorist targets throughout Gaza. These targets included weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, terrorist cells, and various military structures embedded within the densely populated strip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The consistent use of UNRWA facilities to store weaponry and shelter terrorist operatives must prompt immediate international action. The complicity demonstrated by the repeated presence of arms within these \u201chumanitarian\u201d sites cannot be ignored. It is essential that UNRWA\u2019s operations are subjected to stringent scrutiny to ensure that aid and relief structures do not continue to serve as havens for terrorism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of weaponry in an UNRWA facility further solidifies the organization\u2019s complicity in enabling terrorist operations. UNRWA&#8217;s role is far from neutral; it is an active participant that facilitates and protects the strategic assets of groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad. This pattern calls for urgent international reassessment and accountability to prevent further exploitation of humanitarian structures for violent purposes.</p>\n",
