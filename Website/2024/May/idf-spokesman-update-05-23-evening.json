We failed to protect you, your friends, many soldiers, and residents. We are committed to bringing you home. The video serves as a reminder of our moral duty to swiftly return you and the 123 other kidnapped individuals. Your families have chosen to release this film, doing everything possible to bring you home quickly. We will not rest until you are safely returned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Efforts to Bring Kidnapped Home</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The video has sparked poignant questions, primarily, &#8220;How could this have happened?&#8221; It is the responsibility of the IDF to provide thorough answers to these inquiries, first to the families and then to the public via the media. In light of the failures on October 7th, it is now our duty to deeply investigate and ensure such an incident never occurs again at any of our borders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Current Military Operations in Gaza</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, three IDF brigades are engaging in intense combat across all parts of the Gaza Strip. In the north, Brigade 98 continues its offensive against Hamas, targeting both above and below ground. Recently, special IDF forces eliminated Hamas commander San Fiad in Beit Hanoun, responsible for missile and mortar attacks against Israel and our forces during the war.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Operations in Southern Lebanon and Jenin</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning, an IDF aircraft successfully targeted and eliminated Hezbollah militant Mohammad Ali Nazar Faran, responsible for arms manufacturing and supply in Southern Lebanon. Faran was involved in producing weaponry intended against Israeli civilians. Meanwhile, in Jenin, IDF, Shin Bet, and Border Police completed a 40-hour operation, destroying approximately 20 terror infrastructures, including an explosives laboratory and numerous weapons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Accountability and Investigation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to questions about prior warnings before October 7th and the preparedness of our forces, these issues will be examined through IDF investigations and likely external committees. We are committed to transparency in addressing public inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act, ensuring the public is informed about potential Hamas attacks, as reviewed in ongoing investigations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Further Actions in Rafah and Lebanon</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Operations in Rafah serve multiple strategic purposes, which are not detailed publicly to maintain operational security. Our role ultimately aims to create a different security reality that allows northern residents to safely return home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our current priority is to bring home the kidnapped. We will continue to act vigorously against Hezbollah and Hamas across all fronts to dismantle these threats. Thank you.</p>\n",
