This has been compounded by limited income sources, leading to high unemployment rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how did Gaza reach this dire situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand, let&#8217;s compare it with China&#8217;s approach. In 1969, China was concerned that its 2.7% population growth rate would lead to unsustainable overcrowding and diminished quality of life. As a result, China implemented measures to limit birth rates, leading to a current population density of only 152 people per square km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, the Gaza Strip in 1997, under the leadership of the PLO and the Islamic Movement for approximately 20 years, had a density of 2,828 people per square km with a 3.6% growth rate. Despite the warning signs, no steps were taken to curb this explosive growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Hamas assumed control in 2007, the density soared even higher to 3,827 people per square km, yet still, no measures were implemented to address the overcrowding issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has led to the situation in the Gaza Strip today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One has to wonder\u2014why the inaction despite the catastrophic trajectory? Why haven\u2019t organizations like Hamas or the PLO prioritized limiting runaway population growth as a key policy issue for ensuring a minimum quality of life for Gazans?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"1XWruy\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-1XWruy layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-Pp0YJd\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"Pp0YJd\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"525\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-density-97.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2659\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-density-97.jpg 525w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-density-97-300x173.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" /></figure>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-9wdVQn\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"9wdVQn\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"529\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-density-24.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2658\" style=\"width:561px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-density-24.jpg 529w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-density-24-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px\" /></figure>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
