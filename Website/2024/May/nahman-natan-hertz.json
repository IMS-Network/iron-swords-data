He was a dedicated and brave fighter, serving as a reservist in the reconnaissance battalion 6551, part of the 551st division. Nahman tragically lost his life in Metula due to a drone explosion on a Monday, leaving behind a wife, Joanna Shoshana, and two young daughters, Abigail and Talia. He also left behind a grieving family and community who cherished him for his kindness, strength, and selflessness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahman was known for his deep love for his country, which led him to make the ultimate sacrifice. He immigrated to Israel with his wife several years ago, and his commitment to protecting the land of Israel was evident throughout his life. His wife, Joanna, described him as her soulmate, a loving husband, and a perfect father. In her tearful eulogy, she expressed her deep grief and disbelief, saying, &#8220;Nahman, my love, my heart is broken. I was lucky to have you, the perfect husband and father. How do I continue now? You were always there, supporting me. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re gone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna also remembered their shared dreams\u2014building a business, adopting a dog, and simply living life together. She emphasized Nahman\u2019s strength and selflessness, always thinking of others before himself. \u201cYou were so strong,\u201d she said, \u201ceveryone should learn from you.\u201d She promised to continue being the best mother she could be for their two daughters and to tell them stories of their father, the hero who gave his life for his country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahman\u2019s sister, Adel, also shared her pain in losing her brother, describing him as a fighter with a pure heart, always putting others first. \u201cYou were always there for everyone,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cHow do we move forward without you?\u201d She highlighted Nahman\u2019s courage and perseverance, qualities that defined him both in his personal life and on the battlefield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His brother, Israel, echoed these sentiments, calling Nahman his personal hero. \u201cYou weren\u2019t just a war hero, you were our hero. You always felt for others and gave your heart and soul,\u201d Israel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahman was the fourth soldier from the settlement of Elazar to have fallen since October 7, 2023, during a time of increased conflict in the region. The head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council, Yaron Rosenthal, expressed the deep loss felt by the entire community, stating, \u201cWe were blessed to have Nahman as part of our community, and we learned from him the love and commitment to the land of Israel.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nahman\u2019s legacy is one of strength, love for his family, and dedication to his people and homeland. His memory will live on in the hearts of his family, friends, and fellow soldiers, who remember him as a hero, a loving father, and a source of inspiration.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Nahman </h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Natan Hertz</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">31</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">06 May 2024</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">551st Paratroopers Brigade</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Master sergeant</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
