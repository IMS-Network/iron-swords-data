        "rendered": "\n<p>In an alarming development that underscores UNRWA\u2019s active complicity in terror operations, an anti-tank missile was fired from within an UNRWA school at IDF troops. This incident is a stark illustration of how UNRWA facilities are not merely passive backdrops but active sites supporting Hamas\u2019s military activities. The missile launch prompted an immediate response from the 12th Brigade combat team, which conducted operations within the school complex, which also housed a mosque and a medical clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Deadly Encounter: The Human Cost of Terrorism Embedded in Civilian Spaces</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As IDF troops executed a sweep-and-clear operation in the adjacent medical clinic, they encountered lethal traps set by Hamas operatives. Two booby-trapped tunnel shafts detonated, resulting in the tragic deaths of Staff Sergeant Amir Galilove, Staff Sergeant Uri Bar Or, and Staff Sergeant Ido Appel of the 50th Battalion, Nahal Brigade. These casualties underscore the high price Israel pays in combating a deeply embedded terror network that operates from within civilian and humanitarian facilities, including those under UNRWA\u2019s control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Weapons Cache and Tunnel Network Discovered</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF\u2019s operation revealed the extent of the terrorist infrastructure concealed within the school complex. Large quantities of weapons, including firearms and grenades, were discovered, further confirming that the facility was used for far more than education or aid. Even more concerning was the discovery of significant tunnel shafts inside the classrooms, connecting to an extensive underground network utilized for terrorist movement and operations. This discovery exemplifies the systematic use of UNRWA sites as strategic assets for Hamas\u2019s military ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12th-brigade-operations-infographic-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18603\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12th-brigade-operations-infographic-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12th-brigade-operations-infographic-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12th-brigade-operations-infographic-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12th-brigade-operations-infographic-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12th-brigade-operations-infographic.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Direct Involvement: A Pattern Too Clear to Ignore</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident is not an isolated event but part of an established pattern where UNRWA facilities provide cover for terrorist activities. By allowing its schools, clinics, and warehouses to become integrated into Hamas\u2019s infrastructure, UNRWA has shown itself not as a neutral body but as an active enabler of terrorism. The presence of weapons and tunnel access points within an UNRWA school reveals the agency\u2019s deep-seated involvement in facilitating operations that lead to violence and death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firing of an anti-tank missile from an UNRWA school, followed by the discovery of a weapons cache and tunnel network, must prompt immediate action from the global community. The use of civilian and humanitarian facilities as shields by Hamas, with UNRWA\u2019s implicit cooperation, demands stringent oversight and accountability. Without decisive measures, these facilities will continue to serve dual purposes, cloaked under the guise of humanitarianism while contributing to violence and instability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tragic deaths of IDF soldiers and the continued use of UNRWA facilities as terror bases highlight an urgent need to reassess the organization\u2019s role. It is clear that UNRWA\u2019s infrastructure is not neutral but complicit in acts of terrorism that endanger both military personnel and civilians. The world must recognize and act upon this reality to ensure that humanitarian organizations are held accountable and that their facilities do not become sanctuaries for those intent on perpetuating conflict.</p>\n",
