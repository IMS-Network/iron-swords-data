They renamed it from Judea to Palestina, a name inspired by the Philistines, ancient adversaries of the Israelites, in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> This term &#8220;Palestine&#8221; was later adopted by the British during their mandate period. The modern Palestinian identity has indeed adopted this name, which originated from these imperial powers. In contrast, the modern state of Israel, established in 1948, signifies a reclamation of the ancient, indigenous name for the Jewish homeland, reconnecting the Jewish people with their historical roots.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"StandWithUs+: Indigenous - The Story of the Jewish people in Israel\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSBavvVi038?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",
