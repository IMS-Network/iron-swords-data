I&#8217;m Eylon Levy. Today is May 26th, 2024. It is day 233 of the October 7th war. In just the last hour, Hamas fired rockets from the Gaza Strip towards the greater Tel Aviv area, setting off sirens. The rockets were fired from the city of Rafa, as Hamas uses Rafa as a base for attacking Israel. There is an intense international campaign to force Israel to stop its military operations in Rafa and create a safe zone for Hamas to continue attacking Israel\u2019s people. However, this campaign is neither based on law nor fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">International Court of Justice Ruling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Misinterpretation by Media and Actual Ruling</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to give you some news about Rafa that may surprise you. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last Friday that Israel can continue to pursue the Hamas terror regime everywhere in Gaza, including in Rafa. Contrary to media reports, the ICJ did not order Israel to halt its operations. The government of South Africa asked the ICJ to demand that Israel halt its military operations in Gaza and withdraw its forces. The ICJ rejected South Africa\u2019s request but used vague language in its ruling. The ICJ stated that Israel must &#8220;immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Rafa government which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel responded by emphasizing that it is not taking any action that could create such conditions. Israel is sending massive amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza and urging Palestinians to evacuate Hamas strongholds to avoid such a reality. This is a war against Hamas, not the people of Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Judges&#8217; Interpretations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Judges&#8217; Opinions on the Ruling</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of the judges who voted in favor of the ruling, Judge Nter from Germany and Judge Aresu from Romania, clarified that the ruling is not about Israeli actions that do not risk violating the Genocide Convention. Judge Julia Seutin from Uganda criticized the court&#8217;s wording, suggesting it could be misconstrued as ordering an indefinite unilateral ceasefire. Judge ad hoc Aon Barak of Israel also dissented, stating that Israel is not prevented from carrying out its operation in Rafa against Hamas and to bring the hostages home, as long as the operation doesn\u2019t violate the Genocide Convention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Criticism of ICJ and Judge Salam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accusations of Bias and Political Influence</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICJ ruling has been criticized for its political bias and overreach. The president of the court, Judge Naf Salam, a former Lebanese diplomat, has publicly expressed his opinions against Israel and should recuse himself. His involvement undermines the credibility of the ICJ, which is meant to be a pillar of the post-World War II rules-based international order.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ICJ&#8217;s Instructions to Israel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Impact of ICJ&#8217;s Ruling on the Conflict</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICJ instructed Israel to keep the Rafa border crossing open. However, the crossing is controlled by Egypt, which has closed it and has been blocking aid from entering Gaza. The ICJ did not address Egypt\u2019s role, raising questions about the feasibility of its ruling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ongoing Conflict and International Pressure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hamas&#8217; Strategy and International Dynamics</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas is encouraged by the ICJ\u2019s ruling and continues to attack Israel from Rafa. Israel maintains its right to defend itself and to rescue hostages, despite the ICJ\u2019s politically motivated and impractical directives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions and Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Addressing Public Inquiries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Question from Randy Perry on Instagram Live</strong>: How long is it expected to take to search out and eliminate all the rocket launchers from Rafa or Gaza in general?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Answer</strong>: The IDF believes Rafa is the last place in the Gaza Strip where Hamas still has a serious stockpile of weapons. The operation will take as long as necessary, prioritizing the safety of civilians.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Question from Bob Luck on Instagram Live</strong>: What incentives are leading Egypt to keep the Rafa Crossing closed?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Answer</strong>: Egypt has discovered at least 50 tunnels crossing from Rafa into Egyptian territory, used by Hamas to smuggle weapons. The closure is an attempt to control these activities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Question from Shiri on Instagram</strong>: Recently in the UK, there was a cinema vandalized ahead of a screening of a film about the Nova Music Festival Massacre. What is your opinion about this?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Answer</strong>: It is horrific to see attempts to cover up the evidence of Hamas&#8217; atrocities. The vandalism reflects a broader effort by pro-Hamas supporters to deny or glorify these crimes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Question from Claudia</strong>: There are many non-Jews like me supporting Israel and showing solidarity. What do you need, and how can we start a cooperation?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Answer</strong>: Thank you for your support. We need more people to stand with us, to amplify the truth about Israel, and to counter the lies. Join us in sharing our message and supporting Israel\u2019s right to defend itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing Remarks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Invitation for Continued Support</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for following us on social media. We will now take questions live. Please submit your questions in the comments, and we will address them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay tuned for daily briefings at 3:00 PM Israel time and 8:00 AM Eastern time on all major social media platforms. Thank you, and keep safe.</strong></p>\n",
