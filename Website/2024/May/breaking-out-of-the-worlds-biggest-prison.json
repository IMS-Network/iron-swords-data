Here&#8217;s how they did it:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of invading their neighboring country, slaughtering over 1,000 citizens at the border, raping women, burning children, and kidnapping hundreds of citizens, including babies and the elderly, they took a different approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they found ways to bypass their neighbors. Ten years after the initial lockup, they opened a harbor, and twenty years later, they established a commercial airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They did even more\u2026</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 30 years, they signed a peace treaty with one of their neighboring states, allowing mutual trade and tourism. Fifteen years later, they signed a second peace treaty with another enemy country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1994, they had effectively freed themselves from their imprisonment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tiny country is, of course, Israel. It was trapped between Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan and also had to deal with the Arabs living in Israel, who were initially seen as enemies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, when you hear the term &#8220;biggest open-air prison,&#8221; you might think of Gaza. However, Gaza isn&#8217;t the biggest one, and the people there handled their situation differently, bringing their current state upon themselves. Look where that got them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"848\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"2534\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/map_of_gaza_strip_with_no-go_zone_2012-mapsland--848x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2534\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/map_of_gaza_strip_with_no-go_zone_2012-mapsland--848x1024.jpg 848w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/map_of_gaza_strip_with_no-go_zone_2012-mapsland--249x300.jpg 249w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/map_of_gaza_strip_with_no-go_zone_2012-mapsland--768x927.jpg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/map_of_gaza_strip_with_no-go_zone_2012-mapsland--1272x1536.jpg 1272w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/map_of_gaza_strip_with_no-go_zone_2012-mapsland--1697x2048.jpg 1697w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Gaza</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"2535\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/six_day_war_territories.by-user-ling-nutderivative-work-rafy-683x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2535\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/six_day_war_territories.by-user-ling-nutderivative-work-rafy-683x1024.png 683w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/six_day_war_territories.by-user-ling-nutderivative-work-rafy-200x300.png 200w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/six_day_war_territories.by-user-ling-nutderivative-work-rafy-768x1152.png 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/six_day_war_territories.by-user-ling-nutderivative-work-rafy.png 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n",
