They have been digging here for years for defense, and this isn&#8217;t taken down in a week nor in a month. Our mission, as the commander said, is to kill as many commanders, as many terrorists as possible, to destroy the infrastructure. The pressure we want to apply, will also help us to squeeze and bring living captives alive. We are ready to undertake dangerous and complicated operations to bring back the bodies of our captives to be buried in Israel. This holds great value and I ask you to speak with the fighters about these things. We are dismantling the military arm of Hamas, we want to bring our captives alive back home, and we want to bring back those captives who are unfortunately no longer alive to be buried in Israel. These are very important tasks. This message that even though there was a place here we didn&#8217;t reach last time, and now we are reaching it, there&#8217;s no place, no matter how many explosives he has put in a wall and how many traps he has set &#8211; there&#8217;s no place that can withstand the attack of the IDF&#8217;s artillery.&#8221;</p>\n",
