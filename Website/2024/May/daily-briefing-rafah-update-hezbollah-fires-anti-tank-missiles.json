If you&#8217;re watching live online, please feel free to start submitting your questions now. I&#8217;ll try to address them during this session or later in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Current Situation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hostages:</strong> 125 hostages remain in Hamas terror dungeons, including my 19-year-old cousin, AUM.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>International Response:</strong> Despite the dire situation, many world leaders are advocating for Israel to abandon these hostages, potentially allowing Hamas to continue their attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recent Military Actions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Israeli Airstrike in Rafah:</strong> Targeted two high-ranking Hamas terrorists. Despite efforts to minimize civilian casualties through precise intelligence and measures like aerial surveillance, accidental civilian losses occurred due to shrapnel hitting a nearby fuel tank.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Prime Minister&#8217;s Statement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret over the civilian casualties, emphasizing the unintended nature of the incident and the ongoing investigation by the IDF&#8217;s Military Advocate General.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hezbollah&#8217;s Involvement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Recent aggression from Hezbollah includes anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon and UAVs entering Israeli airspace. This ongoing threat highlights the failure of resolutions demanding Hezbollah&#8217;s disarmament.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Humanitarian Efforts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Aid to Gaza:</strong> 378 trucks, inspected in Israel, recently crossed into Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing. Despite challenges, Israel continues to facilitate substantial humanitarian aid.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rafah Border Situation:</strong> Questions arise as Egypt keeps the Rafah border crossing closed, impacting aid flow from Egypt to Gaza.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Viewer Questions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Leor on Instagram:</strong> Inquires about a shooting incident on the Israel-Egypt border. The details are currently under investigation, with no casualties reported on the Israeli side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Neeve on Instagram:</strong> Questions the comparison of Hamas&#8217;s intentional attacks on October 7th with Israel&#8217;s defensive actions. It&#8217;s essential to recognize the difference in intentions and objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Paul on Instagram:</strong> Wonders why the rocket attacks on Tel Aviv and surrounding areas receive less media attention, highlighting the effectiveness of Israel&#8217;s Iron Dome system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Sarah on Instagram:</strong> Asks how ordinary citizens can support the hostages. Raising awareness and advocating for their release are critical steps everyone can take.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining today&#8217;s briefing. Please follow the Israeli Citizen Spokesperson&#8217;s Office on social media platforms for updates. Join us again tomorrow at 3:00 PM Israeli time, 8:00 AM Eastern time, for our next daily briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This format organizes the information into clear sections, making it easier to follow and understand. Each section is highlighted to quickly identify key topics and responses.</p>\n",
