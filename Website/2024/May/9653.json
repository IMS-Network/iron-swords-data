Another section of the tunnel deep within the Strip, which was part of a complex network of tunnels belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization, was attacked several times during the &#8216;Iron Dome&#8217; war. Following research and mapping efforts carried out in recent weeks, it was found that the aerial bombardments had destroyed the tunnel.<br />\nThe second tunnel was part of the same complex network of tunnels belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization, and was dug to a distance of about 150 meters from the border fence, but never crossed into Israeli territory. The tunnel was destroyed using explosives.</p>\n<p>The IDF will continue to work to destroy the underground infrastructure in the Gaza Strip and to deny the capabilities of terrorist organizations, led by Hamas, to protect the settlements in the strip.</p>\n<p>Attached is documentation of the tunnel destruction: https://bit.ly/44yhXvF</p>\n<p>Attached is a sync of the commander of the Subterranean Warfare Unit in the Gaza Division, Lt.
