There are no easy achievements. And we need to be much more persistent than the other side, much more persistent. And we are looking but forward, and you will see, the way to restore the residents on the northern border with security also passes through a lot of skill and proper planning and a lot of persistence. You see the brigade with a lot of action, a lot of experience, a lot of achievements and also a price, which we are very aware of. But I am telling you, we are with determination, persistence, and readiness for challenges in the north, and also in actions in the south, and also in fighting terror in Judea and Samaria. And we are moving forward with this, very much relying on the people, very much relying on the reserve soldiers whose strong presence gives a lot of security also in readiness and also in professionalism. Train, lift up, we are moving forward.&#8221;</p>\n",
