Sarah lived with her family for over a year in the ghetto, and after her mother was murdered, the surviving members of her family found shelter in a dense forest, where they hid for 3 years. In the summer of 1944, Sarah and her two sisters were transferred to Lena Kuehler&#8217;s orphanage, and in 1947 she immigrated to Israel, to Givat Haim Kibbutz. Today, she lives in Yavne and she and her husband Avraham have three daughters, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.<br />\nA video from the meeting between the IDF General Staff Forum and Holocaust survivor, Ms. Sarah Weinstein, is attached: https://bit.ly/4dpADl3<br />\nPhotos on the topic are attached: https://idfanc.activetrail.biz/ANC8683<br />\nThe full remarks of the Chief of Staff are attached: &#8220;A renewed anti-Semitic ideology is raising its head and pernicious enemies are repeatedly seeking our destruction. If we only hope, nothing will happen; if we suffice to say what to do and wait for others to do it &#8211; we cannot be sure it will indeed happen. Therefore, out of hope and responsibility, we must act. The State of Israel and the IDF are our answer to every enemy. To all enemies. We know how to rise from ruin, to learn and rebuild. This is our duty. We bear the responsibility to continue and lead the IDF in the fight for the freedom of the people of Israel, and to ensure &#8211; never again! May the memory of the six million be blessed&#8221;.</p>\n",
