During the operation, while sweeping and clearing the medical clinic, troops encountered two explosive charges set in booby-trapped tunnel shafts. Tragically, one of the explosions claimed the lives of three soldiers from the 50th Battalion of the Nahal Brigade: Staff Sergeant Amir Galilove, Staff Sergeant Uri Bar Or, and Staff Sergeant Ido Appel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation also uncovered a significant cache of weapons within the school complex, including firearms and grenades.
