From a young age, she stood out with her radiant smile, boundless curiosity, and fierce determination that promised greatness. Her family, friends, and teachers saw in her a remarkable individual destined to make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Omer attended Shikma High School in Yad Mordechai, where her brilliance was evident, especially in physics and mathematics. Her teacher, Dganit Karni-Becher, remembered her as a quiet, humble, and inquisitive student with a heart full of goodness. Omer had big dreams, including traveling the world and studying civil engineering, and she was dedicated to making those dreams a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Omer\u2019s sense of duty to her country took precedence. She enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces, serving as a Staff Sergeant in the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps at the Northern Command base in Tzfat (Safed). Known for her diligence and professionalism, Omer\u2019s commitment to her role was unwavering. She was scheduled to be discharged the following month but planned to continue serving in the reserves due to the ongoing conflict. Her selfless dedication to her nation was unparalleled, always putting her country\u2019s needs before her own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, on February 14, 2024, Omer\u2019s life was cut short. During a rocket attack on the Tzfat area, the Iron Dome defense system failed to intercept the onslaught. Amidst the chaos, as sirens blared, Omer was struck while attempting to reach a shelter. She was fatally wounded by one of the rockets, one of eleven fired that day, which resulted in two hitting the base and injuring eight soldiers. The incident prompted a swift military response, heightening tensions in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Omer\u2019s untimely death sent shockwaves through her community and the entire nation. Her mother, devastated by grief, shared her disbelief: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe the knock on the door has reached me too.&#8221; This sentiment echoed the heartbreak felt by all who knew Omer\u2014a promising life, rich with dreams, taken too soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her funeral was a testament to her impact on those around her. Held at the military section of the cemetery in Moshav Gaya, the ceremony was filled with mourners who gathered to pay their respects. Omer\u2019s grandmother, Aliza, expressed the family\u2019s deep sorrow: \u201cMy Omer, my beloved granddaughter. The heart is broken and struggles to keep beating.\u201d Itamar Revivo, head of the Ashkelon Coast Regional Council, conveyed the community&#8217;s collective mourning, offering condolences to the Benjo family and honoring Omer\u2019s memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the days following her passing, stories of Omer\u2019s kindness and generosity continued to surface. She was remembered as a dedicated soldier and a beacon of hope and positivity. Although her dreams of traveling the world and pursuing a career in civil engineering were unfulfilled, her memory lives on in the hearts of those she touched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dganit Karni-Becher, reflecting on Omer\u2019s death, was reminded of the fragility of life and the harsh realities faced by many young Israelis. Omer was one of four students the school lost, including Tal Keren, Or Teasa, and Nadav Tayeb. The compounded grief highlighted the tragic loss of so many promising young lives, each full of potential and aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amidst the sorrow, there is a resolve to honor Omer&#8217;s legacy by embodying the values she cherished\u2014kindness, determination, and the pursuit of dreams. Her story is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who serve their country and the enduring legacy of those who dedicate their lives to a cause greater than themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In remembering Staff Sergeant Omer Sarah Benjo, we honor not just a soldier, but a remarkable young woman whose life was a beacon of light to all who knew her. May her memory be a blessing, and may her spirit continue to inspire those who strive to make the world a better place.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><a class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></a></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Omer Sarah</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Benjo</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">20</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">14 February 2024</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">91st Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Staff sergeant</h2>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
