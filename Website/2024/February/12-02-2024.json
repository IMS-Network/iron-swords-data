        "rendered": "<h1>Humanitarian Aid Transfer to Gaza Strip</h1>\n<p>Trucks carrying humanitarian aid were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip yesterday (Feb. 11). A total of 57 trucks were inspected at Nitzana and transferred via the Rafah Crossing, while 157 were inspected and transferred via Kerem Shalom.</p>\n<h2>Crossing Operations and Agreements</h2>\n<p>In line with the agreement reached with the US, Egypt, and the UN, the Kerem Shalom and Nitzana crossings will be closed on Saturdays. This is to facilitate the UN&#8217;s distribution of the goods on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom and the reception on the Egyptian side of Rafah.</p>\n<h2>Entry of Fuel and Essential Supplies</h2>\n<p>Yesterday (Feb. 11), four tankers of cooking gas and two tankers of fuel, designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza, entered the Gaza Strip. Additionally, the IDF recently facilitated the delivery of over 20 oxygen tanks and other medical equipment to Al Amal Hospital in Khan Yunis. This effort was coordinated by COGAT officers, the hospital, and international aid organizations.</p>\n<h2>Hospital Coordination Amid Challenges</h2>\n<p>Due to the use of the hospital by terrorists as an operational hideout, intricate coordination was carried out with an international aid organization and local officials to ensure security and efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Water Supply Project in Gaza</h2>\n<p>The second waterline from the Egyptian side of Rafah to the Gazan side of Rafah was successfully connected. This project, executed by the United Arab Emirates, is expected to supply water to residents of the southern part of Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Baking Operations in Gaza</h2>\n<p>Currently, 15 bakeries are operational in Gaza, providing over 2 million breads, rolls, and pita breads daily for the local population. Over the past two weeks, the number of operational bakeries increased from 10 to 12 and now to 15, thanks to COGAT&#8217;s facilitation. The coordination for the repair of vital infrastructure was successfully completed.</p>\n<h2>Foreign Nationals Coordination and Humanitarian Aid Movement</h2>\n<p>Seventy foreign nationals are coordinated to exit the Gaza Strip today (Feb. 12). Between 10:00 and 14:00 today, the IDF will pause operations in the Al-Salam neighborhood of the town of Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, to facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>Current Medical Efforts</h2>\n<p>Currently, the IDF is conducting precise operations against the Hamas terrorist organization in Khan Yunis. IDF intelligence suggests that Hamas terrorists are operating from inside and around the Nasser hospital and Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis.</p>\n<h2>Collaboration with Medical Staff</h2>\n<p>The IDF has been communicating with the hospital directors and medical staff, both via phone and on the ground, to ensure that the hospitals remain operational and accessible during this critical time. Prior to commencing operations in the area, proactive measures were taken to ensure the hospitals had sufficient fuel and supplies to maintain functionality throughout the duration of our operation against Hamas.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 10, the IDF facilitated the delivery of over 20 oxygen tanks and additional medical equipment to Al Amal Hospital in Khan Yunis, coordinated by COGAT officers, the hospital, and international aid organizations.</p>\n",
