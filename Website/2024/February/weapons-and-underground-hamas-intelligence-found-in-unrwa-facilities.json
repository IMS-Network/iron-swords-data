        "rendered": "\n<p><strong>IDF and ISA forces have executed strategic operations in northern and central Gaza, aimed at dismantling terrorist strongholds.</strong> These missions uncovered disturbing proof that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), far from serving as a neutral humanitarian organization, actively facilitates the operations of Hamas \u2013 a terrorist group driven by a relentless mission to destroy Israel and propagate terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA: A Shield for Hamas</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF&#8217;s raid in the Shati area revealed a crucial piece of intelligence: a network of tunnels stretching beneath UNRWA facilities. One of these tunnels, located near a UNRWA school, spanned 700 meters and was equipped with sophisticated infrastructure, including blast doors. Notably, this tunnel connected directly under the UNRWA main headquarters in Gaza. The implications were damning \u2013 UNRWA provided cover and access for Hamas\u2019s strategic operations. This goes beyond negligence; it is tacit cooperation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, electrical connections were found tying the UNRWA building\u2019s power grid directly to the tunnel, showcasing UNRWA&#8217;s role not just as a bystander but as an enabler of terror infrastructure. This setup is not just coincidental but emblematic of a larger, insidious collusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Weapons Hoarded in the Guise of Humanitarian Aid</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon raiding the UNRWA headquarters, IDF troops discovered caches of weaponry \u2013 rifles, grenades, and explosives \u2013 hidden in rooms used by UNRWA and its associated humanitarian partners. Documents seized confirmed that Hamas operatives frequented these offices, leveraging UNRWA\u2019s global legitimacy to plan and execute violent actions against Israeli civilians. Such findings paint an undeniable picture: UNRWA&#8217;s role in Gaza extends well beyond humanitarian assistance; it is a front for facilitating terrorist activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Calculated Indoctrination and Manipulation Strategy</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA, under the leadership of General Philippe Lazzarini, operates with more than just humanitarian motives. This organization, purportedly formed to aid the people of Gaza, plays a pivotal role in perpetuating their status as refugees indefinitely. By doing so, it ensures that generations are raised in conditions ripe for indoctrination \u2013 conditions where children are educated to adopt the same hatred that fuels Hamas&#8217;s lethal agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The curriculum and programs administered by UNRWA are accused of glorifying violence and reinforcing narratives that justify terrorism, aligning seamlessly with Hamas&#8217;s ideology. This symbiosis between UNRWA and Hamas undercuts any claim of neutrality, exposing the organization as an accomplice in keeping Gaza in a state of perpetual conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Perpetuating Conflict, Not Alleviating It</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite presenting itself as a humanitarian entity, UNRWA\u2019s actions \u2013 from allowing tunnel constructions beneath its buildings to facilitating weapon stockpiles \u2013 make it clear that its operations contribute directly to sustaining terror in Gaza. The strategy is straightforward: keep the people trapped in a cycle of dependency and hostility, ensuring that they serve as pawns in a wider scheme to destabilize the region and attack Israeli civilians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The international community, through the UN, unwittingly funds an organization that does not just fail to prevent terror but empowers it. The funds and resources flowing to UNRWA are diverted or misused to prop up Hamas, a reality confirmed by the discovery of tunnels, weapons, and strategic documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UNRWA\u2019s Financial Involvement in Terror Infrastructure</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA\u2019s financial involvement in terrorism has reached new and alarming heights, as evidenced by the discovery of their deep integration with Hamas. Billions of dollars, intended for humanitarian relief, have instead been diverted to construct and maintain an extensive network of tunnels beneath the UNRWA headquarters, with the most notable being a 700-meter long tunnel. The construction of such a tunnel is estimated to cost billions due to the complex engineering, materials, and labor required. UNRWA employees themselves participated in digging these tunnels, directly facilitating Hamas\u2019s terrorist infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This network didn\u2019t end with tunnels; it also encompassed a server farm\u2014an advanced data center maintained under the UNRWA HQ, which was used by Hamas to coordinate and control terrorist operations. Setting up even a modest data center incurs millions of dollars in initial expenses, with operating costs running into millions more each month. Shockingly, UNRWA\u2019s resources and facilities provided power to this center, enabling Hamas\u2019s communication and strategic planning capabilities. This evidence paints a clear picture: UNRWA has misappropriated funds meant for humanitarian aid, redirecting them to bolster Hamas\u2019s terror capabilities through intricate underground infrastructure and digital warfare tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Covert Reality of UNRWA&#8217;s Operations</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant aspect of the recent IDF and ISA findings involves the disclosure that some UNRWA employees have been working covertly for Hamas\u2014an internationally recognized terrorist organization\u2014beyond their official duties. The strategic tunnel found beneath UNRWA&#8217;s central headquarters in Gaza was not just a means of facilitating terror logistics; it represented a pathway enabling UNRWA employees to perform dual roles. By day, they maintained the facade of humanitarian workers; by night, they engaged in supporting Hamas&#8217;s operations, reinforcing the militant infrastructure that perpetuates violence and terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This connection is alarming, revealing a disturbing abuse of the trust and funding provided by the international community. Instead of using the billions of dollars allocated to alleviate suffering, aid, and improve infrastructure for Gaza\u2019s civilians, these resources have been repurposed to support the activities of a terrorist group whose primary aim includes violence against Israeli civilians. The complicity implied by this tunnel linking UNRWA\u2019s facilities directly to Hamas\u2019s network underscores a hidden operational alliance that compromises the credibility of UNRWA and its stated mission of humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tunnel\u2019s existence and its connection to employees reveal how deeply intertwined the organization has become with Hamas, tarnishing any pretense of impartiality. It\u2019s a stark reminder that funding directed to organizations under the guise of aid can sometimes serve dual purposes, ultimately undermining peace and security in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under General Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA has allowed its facilities and influence to become tools for terrorism. For decades, this cycle has been sustained with devastating consequences. The time has come to hold UNRWA accountable, exposing its true nature as more than a facilitator but as a direct enabler of terror. The world must confront this reality and demand transparency and responsibility from those who claim to provide aid while enabling violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Animated Infographic Showing the Underground Route Passing Between UNRWA Infrastructure\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0d97aNYjsM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
