Now you ask me how this will happen? We&#8217;re in uniform, and even when you go home, the role is to think readiness for war. This is our primary mission, no one shares this with us and we&#8217;re now focused on being ready for war in the North.<br />\nThis dialogue between us and local leadership here is very, very important, so I&#8217;m telling you, in the end we will be ready for war, if it doesn&#8217;t end with war, it won&#8217;t end with compromising on achievements, Hezbollah is not here on the border, we will push back all capabilities, it will be much quieter here, there will be much more stability and then we&#8217;ll say residents can return. Is it happening tomorrow? Probably not, it will take some time. I think residents from my conversation with leadership would prefer more time but bring us to a good outcome.&#8221;</p>\n",
