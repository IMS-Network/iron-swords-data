Of these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>32 trucks were inspected at Nitzana and transferred via the Rafah Crossing.</li>\n<li>97 trucks were inspected and transferred via Kerem Shalom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, the content of 500 trucks is waiting to be picked up and distributed by UN organizations on the Gazan side receiving the aid. To facilitate this process, the Kerem Shalom crossing will be closed today, February 16.</p>\n<h2>Fuel and Food Supplies Entering Gaza</h2>\n<p>Yesterday, February 15, several important supplies entered the Gaza Strip:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 tankers of cooking gas.</li>\n<li>2 tankers of fuel designated for the operation of essential infrastructure.</li>\n<li>12 WFP food trucks transferred via Jordan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Coordination of Foreign Nationals</h2>\n<p>In terms of foreign nationals, coordination efforts have led to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>24 individuals exiting the Gaza Strip on February 15.</li>\n<li>53 individuals coordinated for exit today, February 16.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Water Supply Project</h2>\n<p>A significant development is the successful connection of the second waterline from the Egyptian side of Rafah to the Gazan side. This project, completed by the United Arab Emirates, is expected to provide water to residents of the southern part of Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Operational Bakeries in Gaza</h2>\n<p>Currently, 15 bakeries are operational in Gaza, providing over 2 million bread rolls and pita breads each day to the local population. The number of operational bakeries has increased from 10 to 12, and finally to 15, thanks to the facilitation of COGAT.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Aid Movement in Rafah</h2>\n<p>Additionally, the coordination for the repair of vital infrastructure has been successfully completed.
