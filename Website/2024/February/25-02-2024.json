This is to facilitate the UN&#8217;s distribution of goods on the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom and the reception on the Egyptian side of Rafah.</p>\n<h2>Logistics of Humanitarian Aid</h2>\n<p>Yesterday, (Feb. 24) 4 tankers of cooking gas designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza entered the Gaza Strip. A truck convoy carrying humanitarian aid was coordinated to northern Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Medical Assistance Initiatives</h2>\n<p>Twelve patients and escorts are expected to exit the Gaza Strip for medical treatment in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates today (Feb. 25).
