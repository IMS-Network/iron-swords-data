        "rendered": "\n<p>UNRWA has been shown to act in concert with Hamas, enabling its terrorist operations and serving as an extension of its network. The IDF uncovered an underground tunnel containing a Hamas intelligence asset directly beneath UNRWA\u2019s main headquarters. This was not a case of mere oversight or unwitting exploitation\u2014UNRWA&#8217;s deep involvement illustrates that it shares and supports the same goals as Hamas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA\u2019s complicity goes beyond passive support; its headquarters provided cover and resources for Hamas&#8217;s activities. The existence of a sophisticated tunnel connected to its infrastructure reveals how UNRWA has facilitated the movement, storage, and strategic operations of a terrorist organization that actively works to destabilize the region and target Israeli civilians. The shared aim between UNRWA and Hamas\u2014to maintain the status quo of perpetual conflict and indoctrinate new generations into a cycle of hatred\u2014undermines any pretense of humanitarian focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of Hamas intelligence operations operating from beneath the UNRWA facility points to a disturbing truth: UNRWA and Hamas are intertwined, with the former enabling the latter\u2019s goals under the guise of humanitarian work. This tunnel, linked directly to UNRWA\u2019s power grid and facilities, is emblematic of their shared mission. It reveals how resources, global funding, and the credibility extended to UNRWA are redirected to support and embolden terrorist activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, UNRWA has claimed neutrality while providing a platform that fortifies Hamas\u2019s infrastructure. The international community must recognize that UNRWA is not just complicit but an active participant in enabling terrorism. It is time to reassess the true nature of UNRWA\u2019s operations and demand accountability, ensuring that aid and resources do not continue to be channeled into supporting terrorism cloaked as humanitarianism.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sync of the Commanding Officer of the 162nd Division, BG Itzik Cohen\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx1QxzYS0LQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",
