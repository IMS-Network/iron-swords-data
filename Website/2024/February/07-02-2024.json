Specifically, 71 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected at the Nitzana crossing and transferred to the Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing, while 132 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred via Kerem Shalom. Out of these, 123 trucks carried food, and 8 trucks were successfully coordinated to shelters in northern Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Gas and Foreign Nationals Movement</h2>\n<p>On Feb. 6, 4 tankers of cooking gas designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza entered the Gaza Strip. Additionally, 548 foreign nationals were coordinated to exit the Gaza Strip on the same day. For today, Feb. 7, 31 foreign nationals are coordinated for exit.</p>\n<h2>Waterline Connection from Egypt</h2>\n<p>The second waterline from the Egyptian side of Rafah to the Gazan side of Rafah was successfully connected. This project, undertaken by the United Arab Emirates, is expected to supply water to residents of the southern part of Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Bakeries and Medical Supplies</h2>\n<p>Currently, 12 bakeries providing 2 million pita breads a day are operational, with additional ones in the planning process. Over the last couple of days, 12 packages of medical supplies were airdropped by Jordan and the Netherlands, designated for medical facilities in the Gaza Strip. The coordination of the repair of vital infrastructure was also successfully completed.</p>\n<h2>IDF Operations Paused for Humanitarian Aid</h2>\n<p>Today, Feb. 7, between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the western neighborhood of the town of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>Field Hospitals and Medical Treatment</h2>\n<p>A French floating hospital was docked at the Al-Arish port for a month, allowing Gazan patients to exit the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing for treatment. Over 2,000 patients were treated and advised on the ship. On Jan. 28, the French vessel completed its mission and returned to its country of origin. In addition, Italy has dispatched a floating hospital equipped with surgery, trauma care, and other medical capabilities, which treated over 100 patients before completing its mission at the end of January 2024.</p>\n",
