        "rendered": "\n<p>Good afternoon. A few hours ago, in a brave and complex special rescue operation, the Chehal and Shabak forces rescued Kid Farhan El Kedi, a 52-year-old resident of Ret and father of one child. About an hour ago, Farhan arrived at Soroka Hospital in good medical condition, where he reunited with his family. This morning, Farhan was rescued alive from an underground tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip by the 13 Diamond Unit and the General Security Service, in a courageous operation led by the 162nd Bank Command with the assistance of the Nahal Brigade and the 401st Brigade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Responsibility and Caution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We urge everyone to show responsibility and caution on social networks and avoid spreading details of the operation. This is crucial for security reasons, to protect the forces involved and the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions and Answers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1:</strong> Was there a battle during the rescue or were the terrorists not present?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation this morning, where we rescued Farhan alive from an underground tunnel, was a complex and courageous effort. Details beyond this will not be commented on at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2:</strong> What do we know about Farhan&#8217;s captivity conditions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farhan has been interrogated in the field. It is essential to carefully manage the details shared with the public to avoid harming other efforts to bring abductees home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Is there a change in the IDF&#8217;s position regarding the rescue of abductees and current conditions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IDF&#8217;s role is to create the best possible conditions for the return of abductees and to present all alternatives to the political echelon. The political echelon will make the final decision, and the IDF will implement it accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4:</strong> Is there a connection between this rescue operation and recent events involving Israeli Arabs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no connection between this operation and the recent events involving Israeli Arabs. This operation was conducted with intelligence and forces focused on the mission at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q5:</strong> Was there specific intelligence information about Kaido during activities for another purpose, and were there other abductees with him?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intelligence Division, General Security Service, and related agencies work tirelessly to gather details about abductees for operational efforts and to inform families. Some details have contributed to the current effort, but further specifics will be shared later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Information</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Farhan was held in the tunnel for 326 days since the beginning of the war. Details about the duration of his captivity and the preparation of the operation will be shared later in an organized manner, first with his family and then with the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Call for Security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors on the internet are concerning, and it is important to know that efforts and operations are ongoing in the field. We ask everyone to support our hostages, protect our forces, and avoid spreading rumors and details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Information on Abductee Location</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q6:</strong> Did information about the abductee&#8217;s location come from recently arrested terrorists in the Gaza Strip?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDF forces are working to obtain information regarding the Philadelphia axis, and efforts continue to scan the area and destroy terrorist infrastructure. The IDF aims to provide a broad range of alternatives to the political level on security matters in this region and will continue to act accordingly.</p>\n",
