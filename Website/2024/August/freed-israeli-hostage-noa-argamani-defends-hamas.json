Israel lies!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This narrative is being spread based on a story Noa posted on her personal Instagram account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noa was expressing frustration with the Israeli media, accusing them of taking things out of proportion. These media outlets, according to Noa, alter the narrative to fit their own agendas, gaining views and profiting from the hostage crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understandably upset by the manipulation of her words, Noa felt compelled to clarify a few crucial points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a story she uploaded on August 23, 2024, she made it clear:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Physical Harm</strong>: Noa stated that she was not beaten during her captivity, and her hair was not cut, countering the claims that have been circulating in the media.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Injury Clarification</strong>: She explained that the injuries she sustained were not from being beaten but were a result of debris from the building that collapsed on her.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Media Manipulation</strong>: Noa emphasized her frustration with the Israeli media, accusing them of distorting her words to fit their own narrative and increase their profits by sensationalizing the hostage crisis.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Noa emphasized that, as a victim of the October 7 massacre, she refuses to be victimized again by the Israeli media narrative, which she believes is designed to line their pockets by exploiting the hostage crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-0wlAQE\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"0wlAQE\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"572\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noa-argamani-story.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15544\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noa-argamani-story.jpeg 572w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noa-argamani-story-171x300.jpeg 171w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" /></figure>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is Noa Argamani</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Noa Argamani is an Israeli woman born on October 12, 1997, who gained international attention after being kidnapped by Palestinians during the Re&#8217;im music festival massacre on October 7, 2023, part of the broader 2023 Palestinian attack on Israel. <br>The incident was widely publicized due to a harrowing video showing her being taken away on a motorcycle, pleading for her life while reaching out for her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, who was also abducted. This footage became emblematic of the hostage crisis, leading to Argamani being referred to as &#8220;the face of the Nova music festival hostages&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since her rescue, Argamani has become an advocate for the remaining hostages held by Hamas. She has participated in various public appearances, including a notable visit to the U.S. Congress where she was recognized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In August 2024, she traveled to Tokyo to meet with diplomats from G7 countries to raise awareness about the plight of other hostages still in captivity</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"xVhNqY\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-xVhNqY layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-NpicE7\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"NpicE7\">\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Io85Fu\">BRING THEM HOME NOW</h1>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How She Was Rescured?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Noa Argamani was rescued by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on June 8, 2024, in a joint operation with Shin Bet and the Israel Police, after enduring 245 days in captivity. <br>The rescue, named &#8220;<a href=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/facts/operation-arnon-4-hostages-rescued/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5046\">Operation Arnon</a>&#8221; in honor of Arnon Zmora, a special forces officer who led the mission and was killed during the operation, took place around 11 a.m. in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza. Argamani, along with three other hostages, was found in one of two houses where they were being held by Hamas militants. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coordinated effort involved a precise and strategic approach, culminating in the hostages being transported by helicopter to Sheba Medical Center for medical examination. Dramatic footage released by the police captured the moment when the rescue unit broke into the building, identified Argamani, and carried her out to safety, with commandos reassuring her, saying &#8220;You are safe&#8221; and &#8220;We&#8217;re taking you home.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rescue, which coincided with Argamani&#8217;s father&#8217;s birthday, was described by him as an incredible gift. Upon her return to Israel, Argamani spoke with President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who expressed their unwavering commitment, telling her, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t give up on you for a moment.&#8221; The successful operation was a significant achievement for the Israeli forces, bringing Argamani and the other hostages to safety after months of captivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-zeever-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a53ecab0dd68756b692b4820edc6d287\">End the Disinformation Campaign <br>Against Noa Argamani<br>Respect her dignity<br>keep her out of your political agendas</h2>\n",
