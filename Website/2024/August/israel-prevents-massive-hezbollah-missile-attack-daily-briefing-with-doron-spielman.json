Now, we all know what he was talking about. This morning, Hezbollah planned to fire hundreds of missiles at Israeli cities, with the intent to bombard and massacre Israelis. Hezbollah had set up missile launchers, aimed at their targets, preparing for a devastating assault.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a precise operation, the Israeli Air Force targeted these launchers, saving countless lives. Hezbollah remains armed and dangerous, continuing to attack Israel. Today, Hezbollah claimed it launched over 300 rockets, missiles, and drones at Israeli civilians. The situation is dire, but it could have been far worse if the Israeli Air Force had not intervened.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Potential Disaster That Was Averted</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Had Hezbollah\u2019s planned attack succeeded, emergency services would have been overwhelmed, missile defense systems would have been unable to stop every missile, and apartment buildings would have been destroyed. Israelis would have been trapped beneath the rubble, fueling Hezbollah\u2019s desire for more killing. Instead, the Israeli Air Force\u2019s actions saved the day, striking thousands of Hezbollah missile launchers before they could be fired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hezbollah has been attacking Israel for 10 months, firing rockets, anti-tank missiles, and suicide drones almost daily since October 8th, when it joined Hamas in its war against Israeli civilians. Over 60,000 Israelis have fled their homes in northern Israel due to these attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah\u2019s Role in Iran\u2019s &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that Hezbollah is trained, financed, and armed by Iran. Hezbollah is part of Iran\u2019s &#8220;Ring of Fire,&#8221; with seven fronts attacking Israel. These fronts include Hamas in Gaza, Hamas in Judea and Samaria, Iranian regimes in Syria, militias in Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen, and, of course, Iran itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran seeks to ignite the Middle East and burn Israel to the ground. Israel is fighting for its survival against enemies determined to destroy it. Some may claim that Israel has no right to carry out preventative strikes, but had Israel hesitated, Tel Aviv would have been under attack right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">International Pressure to Stop Iran and Its Proxies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who wish to prevent a wider war must pressure the international community to stop Iran and its armies from operating throughout the Middle East. Israel did not ask for this war, nor does it want it, but it has shown that it will act to protect its citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah\u2019s &#8220;First Phase&#8221; of Attacks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Cindy on Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;Hezbollah said its attack is finished. What does \u2018first phase finished\u2019 mean? Is there a second phase?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Hezbollah has 150,000 missiles, including precision-guided missiles, aimed at Israel. While they claimed the first phase is over, Hezbollah has been attacking Israel for years and is unlikely to stop now. Their existence calls for the destruction of Israel, and their attacks will likely continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hezbollah\u2019s Targeting of Israeli Military Sites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram Stories:</strong><br><em>&#8220;We hear Hezbollah is only targeting military sites in Israel. What\u2019s your response?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Hezbollah claims to target military sites, but when they killed 12 children playing soccer in Majdal Shams, they also claimed to be targeting military positions. Hezbollah fired 300 missiles and drones directly into Israeli cities. This isn\u2019t a peace gesture\u2014Hezbollah is the epitome of evil, constantly lying about their actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can Israel Dismantle Both Hezbollah and Hamas Simultaneously?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Benji on Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;Can Israel dismantle Hezbollah and Hamas at the same time and ensure security in Judea and Samaria?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Israel has no choice but to defend itself against all threats. As we saw this morning, Israel can act against both Hamas and Hezbollah simultaneously. Every citizen in Israel knows this is a war for the country&#8217;s survival, and Israel will do whatever it takes to protect itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lebanon\u2019s Role in Dealing with Hezbollah</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Daniel on Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;What is Lebanon doing to take back its land and citizens from Hezbollah?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Lebanon has not done enough. Hezbollah has taken over much of the country, and the Lebanese people are crying out against them. The world must apply pressure on Lebanon\u2019s government to take a stand against Hezbollah, which has put Lebanese civilians at risk and destabilized the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel\u2019s Impact on Hezbollah\u2019s Ability to Attack Central Israel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Hillary on Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;To what degree has Israel limited Hezbollah\u2019s ability to attack central Israel?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>This morning, Hezbollah\u2019s planned attack on central Israel was largely averted. However, they still launched 300 drones toward northern Israel, and Hezbollah\u2019s weapons arsenal remains large. Israel remains on high alert and will continue to protect its citizens at any cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hostage Deal Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Near on Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;What\u2019s the latest update on a hostage deal, and what are the factors preventing progress?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Israeli delegations are negotiating in Cairo, trying to secure a hostage release. However, one significant sticking point is the Philadelphia Corridor between Gaza and Egypt. This area has been used by Hamas for smuggling weapons, and Israel cannot afford to reopen this route while hostages remain in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Help Spread the Truth About the War</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Faith on Instagram Live:</strong><br><em>&#8220;What more can we do to help besides sharing the truth on social media?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Amplify the truth about Hezbollah, Hamas, and their connections to Iran. Israel is fighting to protect not only itself but the entire free world from these terror organizations. Keep sharing, speak out, and encourage others to stand on the right side of history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining today\u2019s briefing. Israel is standing strong, defending its citizens against ongoing threats from Hezbollah, Hamas, and their backers in Iran. Tune in every day at 3 p.m. Israel time (8 a.m. EST) for updates and news.
