Hamas has a long history of murdering Israeli civilians, and their leaders continue to vow more violence until Israel is destroyed. Hamas official Khaled Meshaal recently declared that Hamas should resume suicide bombings, a tactic that they pioneered in the 1990s and 2000s. Last week, a Hamas suicide bombing in Tel Aviv failed, killing only the bomber himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, Palestinian terrorists detonated bombs in pizzerias, caf\u00e9s, dance clubs, and buses, murdering countless civilians. On October 7th, Hamas massacred around 1,200 people in Israel, including parents in front of children and children in front of parents. It was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas controls Gaza and has thousands of rockets and weapons smuggled in through the Philadelphia Corridor. The group has been trained and funded by Qatar and Iran, making it a dangerous and persistent threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel\u2019s Policy Against Hamas: The 3 D&#8217;s</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s strategy in this war can be summarized by the &#8220;3 D&#8217;s&#8221;:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Destroy Hamas</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Demilitarize Gaza</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Deradicalize Gazan society</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent troubling reports suggest that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is using hostages as human shields, keeping them handcuffed beside him to avoid being targeted. According to Israeli sources, 108 hostages remain in Gaza, with many more presumed dead. Sinwar and Hamas are committing unspeakable crimes, and they cannot remain Israel\u2019s neighbors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel\u2019s Commitment to Recovering Hostages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel continues to do everything in its power to bring the hostages home. Just last week, IDF forces rescued Kaid Faran Eladi from captivity and retrieved the body of an IDF soldier killed on October 7th. While Israel works to bring its citizens home, it remains committed to preventing future hostage situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">EU Foreign Ministers Target Israel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow, the EU foreign ministers will meet, and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell hinted at an agenda item that\u2019s quite revealing. Borrell has focused not on condemning Hamas, Hezbollah, or Iran, but on the Jewish state itself. Borrell is seeking sanctions on Israeli ministers, including Foreign Minister Israel Katz, whom Borrell accuses of making unacceptable statements against Palestinians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrell\u2019s real issue with Katz seems to be his support for Israel\u2019s anti-terror operations in the West Bank. While Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iraqi militias\u2014backed by Iran\u2014attack Israel on multiple fronts, Borrell is trying to deny Israel the right to defend itself. This absurd and immoral stance needs to be rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel\u2019s Operations in the West Bank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s current operations in the West Bank are aimed at preventing more suicide bombings and massacres like those on October 7th. Yet, European leaders like Belgium\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister have called for sanctions, sending a message that if Israel defends itself, it will be condemned. This twisted logic cannot be tolerated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">UNIFIL\u2019s Role in Lebanon</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;The UN Security Council renewed UNIFIL\u2019s mandate. Does Israel view this positively?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, has been ineffective since its establishment in 1978. It failed to prevent the 2006 war with Lebanon and has done little to stop Hezbollah\u2019s recent attacks on Israel. UNIFIL\u2019s presence is little more than a waste of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel\u2019s Humanitarian Efforts in Gaza</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;What are Israel\u2019s efforts to balance fighting Hamas and preventing a humanitarian crisis in Gaza?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Since the beginning of the war, Israel has balanced military efforts against Hamas while facilitating humanitarian aid into Gaza. Despite the challenges, Israel upholds international law and ensures medical supplies, including polio vaccines, reach the Gazan people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rising Anti-Semitism Worldwide</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;A synagogue was attacked in France recently. Is this a new trend, or will it get worse?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Unfortunately, anti-Semitism is not new, but it has surged since October 7th. Jewish communities around the world must stay vigilant. The rise in violent attacks highlights the importance of the State of Israel as a safe haven for Jews globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Impact of War on Israel\u2019s Home Front</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;How are Israelis coping with the war\u2019s impact on the home front?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Around 80,000 Israelis from the north are displaced, and many children are attending new schools far from their homes. The psychological toll is significant. Organizations like <strong>Save a Farm</strong> are helping Israel\u2019s agricultural community continue supplying food despite the challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Egypt\u2019s Role in the Conflict</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;What role is Egypt playing, given its history with Hamas smuggling weapons?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Egypt plays a complex role. While it is currently mediating negotiations, in the past, weapons were smuggled into Gaza under its watch. Israel hopes future cooperation between Egypt, Israel, and the U.S. will prevent further arms smuggling into Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trusted News Sources for the Conflict</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Question from Instagram:</strong><br><em>&#8220;What news sources do you trust for accurate information?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>While I avoid biased media, I recommend following multiple sources to get a balanced view. An app like <strong>Ground News</strong> can help you see how stories are reported across the spectrum and assess their accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for joining today\u2019s briefing. We\u2019ll be back on Sunday at 3 p.m. Israel time (8 a.m. EST) to bring you more updates. Follow us on social media and stay informed!</p>\n",
