Just yesterday, (Tuesday), Hamas terrorists opened fire toward the humanitarian route in the area of Rafah, as well as launching rockets from the Humanitarian Route in Khan Yunis toward central Israel. Hamas continues to deliberately embed its military assets used to carry out attacks against Israel next to humanitarian infrastructure and the civilian population inside Gaza.</p>\n<h2>Local Tactical Pause</h2>\n<p>Today, (August 14) between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Ghaban neighborhood in Beit Lahya to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n",
