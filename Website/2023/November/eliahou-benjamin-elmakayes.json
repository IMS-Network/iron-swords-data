He had six siblings: Yan, Cyril, Yonatan, Mandy, Jeremy, and Sarah. In 2015, he immigrated to Israel and settled in the Petah Tikva area. On October 7, 2023, he was called up for reserve duty and served in the Engineering Corps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliahou Benjamin Elmakayes was killed in action on November 8, 2023, at the age of 29. He was laid to rest at the Mount Herzl military cemetery. He is survived by his parents and six siblings. After his death, he was posthumously promoted to the rank of Staff Sergeant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elmakayes had moved to Israel specifically to enlist in combat service. His wedding, which was supposed to take place just days before his death, was postponed due to his call-up. His close friend, David Dorfman, described him as always smiling, joyful, and caring. He had a heart of gold and was dedicated to helping others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shirley Perezam, the manager of the lone soldier building where Elmakayes lived, remembered him as a person with an incredibly big heart, always ready to volunteer and help others. He had hoped to bring his parents to Israel, and although they tried to settle in the country, they eventually returned to France due to difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rafael Jourdo, the brother of Elmakayes&#8217; fianc\u00e9e, recounted how he was a true patriot, always smiling and ready to help others. He described Elmakayes as someone who feared nothing and whose life was dedicated to security and endless giving. Instead of celebrating his wedding, his family and friends were faced with the sorrow of his burial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elmakayes, who was supposed to marry his beloved fianc\u00e9e Joanna, had his wedding plans interrupted by the war. He was a lone soldier who had moved to Israel alone to enlist in the IDF and was dedicated to his service and his new homeland. His death on his Hebrew birthday added to the profound grief of his family and friends, who had come to Israel for his wedding but instead attended his funeral.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-top\"></div><div class=\"guten-shape-divider guten-shape-divider-bottom\"></div><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><a class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></a></div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-background-overlay\"></div><div class=\"sticky-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Eliahou Benjamin</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Elmakayes</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">29</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">08 November 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Combat Engineering Corps</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Master sergeant (res.)</h2>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
