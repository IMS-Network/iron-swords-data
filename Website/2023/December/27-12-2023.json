This was conducted at the request of the <strong>@UN</strong>, which led to the closure of the Kerem Shalom crossing for inspection due to logistical constraints on the Gazan side.</p>\n<p>The Kerem Shalom crossing will be closed for inspection again today (December 27) for the same reason.</p>\n<h2>Gas and Humanitarian Aid Operations</h2>\n<p>On December 26, <strong>4 tankers of cooking gas</strong> were successfully transported to the Gaza Strip to support essential infrastructure operations. Additionally, on December 27, between <strong>10:00 and 14:00</strong>, the IDF has announced a pause in operations in the Al-Salam (north) neighborhood of Deir al-Balah to facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>Field Hospitals in Gaza</h2>\n<p>A field hospital operated by the <strong>Red Crescent</strong> in Rafah is expected to begin treating patients in the coming days. This hospital will have a capacity of <strong>50 beds</strong> and a personnel team of <strong>120</strong>, which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 intensive care units</li>\n<li>3 operating rooms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, <strong>4 additional field hospitals</strong> are in the process of setup and are expected to be operational soon. Additional equipment and personnel for these field hospitals have also entered the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Treatment Abroad for Patients</h2>\n<p>In coordination with Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, patients who are ill and wounded are being transferred for treatment to Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, and Qatar. So far, <strong>1,603 ill and wounded</strong> individuals, along with their escorts, have exited the Gaza Strip for medical treatment in these countries.</p>\n<h2>Recent Operational Pauses</h2>\n<p>On December 26, a pause in operations occurred in the <strong>Al-Baruk</strong> and <strong>Yafa</strong> neighborhoods, in the town of Deir al-Balah.</p>\n",
