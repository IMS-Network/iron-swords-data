    },
    "content": {
        "rendered": "\n<p>On December 25, 2023, during a strategic operation in the Tuffah area of northern Gaza, IDF soldiers from the Nahal Brigade of the 162nd Division uncovered explosive devices stored in bags labeled with the UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) logo. This discovery occurred during an engagement targeting Hamas militants suspected of using the &#8220;Al Rafaa&#8221; and &#8220;Zavaha&#8221; schools as hideouts for operational activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Operation Details: Weapon Caches in Schools</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation was prompted by intelligence indicating that Hamas terrorists were embedding themselves within educational institutions. The encounter led to a direct confrontation in which the IDF eliminated a number of terrorists, uncovering a large cache of weaponry in the process. Among the confiscated items were dozens of explosive devices, Kalashnikov rifles, and 15 explosive belts, all concealed within UNRWA-marked bags. This is yet another instance revealing the misuse of humanitarian resources and institutions for terror purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anti-Tank Missile Attack and IDF Response</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>During the operation, a terrorist attempted to strike IDF soldiers with an anti-tank missile. The swift and precise response by an IDF tank neutralized the threat immediately, ensuring the safety of the troops and preventing further escalation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Terrorist Operatives Identified</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Significantly, many of the terrorists hiding within the schools were identified as members of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Several of these operatives were brought in for interrogation, revealing their involvement in past attacks, including the heinous massacre on October 7th, 2023. This underscores the deep entrenchment of terrorist elements within civilian structures and their relentless strategy of using the civilian population as human shields.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Broader Context of UNRWA\u2019s Role</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery of explosive devices and military-grade weaponry in UNRWA-labeled bags adds to the mounting evidence that the organization is entangled in the conflict in a way that goes beyond its humanitarian mandate. Under the leadership of General Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA has faced criticism for enabling terrorist activities, either through negligence or deeper complicity. This operational finding reinforces the call for greater scrutiny of UNRWA and its true role within Gaza, highlighting the perverse strategy of using humanitarian aid to disguise weapon smuggling and terrorist logistics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Human Shields: A Persistent Tactic</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamas&#8217;s strategy of embedding operatives and weaponry in civilian structures, such as schools and homes, continues to endanger innocent lives and violate international laws. By placing military assets and conducting operations within civilian areas, Hamas ensures that any defensive response by Israel risks collateral damage, thus manipulating the narrative to its advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evidence from the December 25th operation must spur urgent international attention and action. The use of schools as cover for militants, coupled with the presence of weapons in UNRWA-labeled bags, starkly demonstrates the deceptive tactics that undermine true humanitarian efforts. The world must take a firm stand against such strategies, demanding oversight and reforms to prevent terrorist groups from exploiting aid and civilian infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident serves as further proof of Israel&#8217;s just and necessary measures to defend itself and its citizens in a battle where terror groups willingly sacrifice civilian safety for their operational goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"18520\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-01-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18520\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-01-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-01-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-01-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-01.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-id=\"18521\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-04-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18521\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-04-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-04-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-04-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-04-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-04.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"18522\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-02-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18522\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-02-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-02-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-02-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-02-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2512-02.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-id=\"18518\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2512-03-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18518\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2512-03-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2512-03-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2512-03-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2512-03-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2512-03.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n",
