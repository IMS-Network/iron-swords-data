He grew up surrounded by the values of hard work and dedication, qualities instilled in him by his family, particularly through the legacy of his father, Philip Hershberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Family and Personal Life</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yochai was a devoted father to four children: Noya, Roy, Neta, and Itai. His love for his children was evident in every aspect of his life, and he was known to be a caring and dedicated parent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Military Service and Tragic Death</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, Yochai was called up for reserve duty, serving in the Human Resources Corps of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Yochai held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was the commander of the Missing Persons Identification Unit within the 98th Division, a role he performed with utmost dedication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, on December 5, 2023, during his reserve service, Yochai was involved in a fatal road accident. He was traveling in a private vehicle with some of his comrades when they collided with a truck on Highway 25 near Sde Teyman. This accident claimed the life of Yochai at the age of 52. He was laid to rest in the military section of the Gedera cemetery, leaving behind his four children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Legacy and the Philip Farm</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond his military service, Yochai was deeply connected to the land, continuing the legacy of his father, Philip Hershberg, who founded the renowned Philip Farm near Kiryat Gat in 1950, shortly after Israel&#8217;s War of Independence. The farm became a symbol of resilience and dedication, offering agricultural activities, tourism, workshops, and donkey tours. It became a popular attraction in the northern Negev, particularly during the &#8220;Red South&#8221; festival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philip Hershberg, Yochai&#8217;s father, was born in Poland in 1908. He had a rich history, with his father having served in the Russian army during World War I. After his father&#8217;s death, Philip was sent to live with his uncle, who owned a large agricultural estate in Poland. There, he acquired the skills and knowledge that later helped him establish the Philip Farm in Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Life of Giving and Coexistence</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yochai was known for his endless generosity and his commitment to helping others. Whether it was assisting stranded travelers or fellow farmers in need, Yochai was always there with a smile on his face. His friend of 30 years, Tzvika Shlomo, who owns a neighboring farm, fondly recalled Yochai\u2019s infectious smile and his tireless efforts to maintain and develop the farm despite the many challenges posed by the authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yochai also stood out as a symbol of coexistence, fostering strong relationships with Bedouin communities in the area. His legacy of generosity and commitment to peaceful coexistence remains a testament to the values he held dear throughout his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"SGEabL\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-SGEabL layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-narrow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-kauciS\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"kauciS\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-divider guten-element guten-divider guten-SjMhFb\"><div class=\"guten-divider-wrapper\"><div class=\"guten-divider-default guten-divider-line guten-divider-regular\"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">social media</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icons guten-qFDqos rounded horizontal fill\">\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icon guten-5P4r0D facebook\"><a id=\"guten-5P4r0D\" href=\"facebook.com/phillip.pharm.negev\"><i class=\"fab fa-facebook\"></i></a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icon guten-70zyKy globe\"><a id=\"guten-70zyKy\" href=\"http://www.philipfarm.co.il/\"><i class=\"fas fa-globe\"></i></a></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-iBOzpq\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"iBOzpq\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"lJQj9h\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-lJQj9h layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-FMvXoR\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"FMvXoR\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"AoXULt\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-AoXULt layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-HVTOTM\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"HVTOTM\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-sZCvB6\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-FAHDBO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"FAHDBO\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-1fRpSR\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-HUmLiC\">Yochai</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Rnglwz\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Phfowq\">Gur Hershberg</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-QZA7GR\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-3mOS2m\">52</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rL4KkZ\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-gemj5o\">05 December 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-tSfK2R\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-M8MjQJ\">98 Division</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-8p4GEi\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-4Fxo9F\">Lieutenant Colonel</h5>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-JEHMjF\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
