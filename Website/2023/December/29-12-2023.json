At the request of the UN, Kerem Shalom was closed for inspection of aid trucks due to logistic constraints on the Gazan side of the crossing.</p>\n<h2>Delivery of Cooking Gas</h2>\n<p>On the same day, 4 tankers of cooking gas designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza have entered the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Access to Clean Water</h2>\n<p>A second water pipeline from mobile desalination facilities situated on the Egyptian side of Rafah was successfully established. This initiative, led by the United Arab Emirates, aims to provide clean water access to approximately 150,000 people.</p>\n<h2>Coordination for Foreign Nationals</h2>\n<p>On December 29, 386 foreign nationals have been coordinated for exit via the Rafah Crossing. Between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Al-Idari neighborhood, in the town of Rafah, in order to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>Field Hospital in Rafah</h2>\n<p>A field hospital in Rafah operated by the Red Crescent is expected to begin treating patients in the coming days. With a capacity of 50 beds and a personnel of 120, the hospital includes 6 intensive care units and 3 operating rooms. Additional field hospitals are in the process and are expected to be operational in the coming days.</p>\n<h2>Additional Support for Field Hospitals</h2>\n<p>Additional equipment and personnel for field hospitals have also entered the Gaza Strip.
