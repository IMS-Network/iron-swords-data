From an early age, Harel\u2019s boundless energy and zest for life were evident. He had an adventurous spirit, constantly seeking out extreme activities and rarely taking a moment to rest. Known for his humor and loyalty, Harel was inseparable from his dog, Chucky, and cherished by those fortunate enough to know him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harel\u2019s personality was marked by a larger-than-life smile that left an indelible mark on everyone he met. He embodied ambition and determination; whether learning to surf by traveling solo to Portugal or obtaining a motorcycle license and buying the most daring bike he could find, Harel achieved every goal he set his mind to. His persistence was especially notable in his military career, where he relentlessly pursued excellence and pushed his team to their utmost capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Military Service and Heroic Sacrifice</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Harel enlisted in the IDF and distinguished himself as an officer in the Givati Brigade\u2019s elite reconnaissance unit. He led his team, known as \u201cTeam Ittah,\u201d through challenging missions, showcasing not only tactical expertise but also profound care and camaraderie. On October 7, 2023, when the Iron Swords War erupted with a brutal attack on Israel, Harel\u2019s bravery came to the forefront. He was quick to respond, leading a daring effort to protect the residents of Kibbutz Nahal Oz from imminent danger. Harel\u2019s commitment to safeguarding lives extended to both people and animals, embodying the very essence of a protector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The war\u2019s demands kept Harel and his team engaged in relentless combat across northern and southern Gaza. His dedication to Israel\u2019s security was unwavering; Harel knew the profound importance of his role and remained resolute in leading his soldiers through the harshest of battles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, on December 22, during an operation in Khan Yunis, Harel sustained critical injuries from an explosive device. For eight days, he clung to life, surrounded by family, friends, and his devoted partner, Nitza Bersarti, a 21-year-old soldier herself. Despite the fervent prayers and the unwavering hope that enveloped his hospital room, Harel succumbed to his injuries on December 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Love and Legacy</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Harel shared a deep and special bond with Nitza, whom he met through a mutual connection facilitated by Nitza\u2019s sister, Noam, an IDF officer who recognized their shared qualities. Their love blossomed with an ease that felt preordained, strengthening them both in their demanding military roles. Their moments together\u2014strolling by the sea in Netanya or riding his motorcycle on spontaneous adventures\u2014were marked by joy and mutual support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as the war\u2019s intensity escalated, Harel made efforts to maintain their connection. He once wrote a brief but heartfelt note on a scrap of a Palestinian newspaper, sent through a fellow soldier: \u201cThere\u2019s no reception here. I love you so much and miss you.\u201d This message, framed and cherished by Nitza, became an emblem of their love and Harel\u2019s enduring spirit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harel\u2019s death left an immeasurable void. His father, Dudu, expressed the pride and deep love he felt for his son, recounting their final conversation filled with affection and respect. His mother, Sigal, remembered the songs they sang together and spoke of her unending devotion to her son, who fought so valiantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Commander and Friend</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Harel\u2019s leadership was characterized by empathy and trust. He forged close bonds with his soldiers, who admired and followed him without hesitation. During his funeral, a wounded soldier from Harel\u2019s unit paid tribute to him, encapsulating the respect and affection Harel commanded: \u201cI am proud to have been your soldier. We love you, all of Team Ittah.\u201d His influence resonated beyond words, inspiring those who served under him to continue their mission with the same unwavering determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Remembering Harel</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that Harel\u2019s legacy of hope and leadership continues, his family and friends initiated the \u201cHarel\u2019s Lighthouse\u201d project. This memorial, set against the sea near his home in Netanya\u2019s Poleg neighborhood, symbolizes the light and strength he brought to the world. Visible from all directions, it serves as a perpetual reminder of Harel\u2019s courage, dedication, and the love that defined his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain Harel Ittah\u2019s story is one of unmatched bravery, boundless love, and an unyielding commitment to protecting his country. His legacy urges us all to strive for a world filled with the light and kindness he so passionately embodied. May his memory be forever blessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-8yEvaM\">IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi About Harel</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"guten-element
