        "rendered": "\n<p>In a stark reminder of the cynical tactics employed by terror groups in Gaza, IDF soldiers uncovered a room used for RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) training inside a mosque in the Jabalya area on December 11, 2023. This shocking discovery highlights the ruthless exploitation of religious sites to serve as covert military training centers, endangering the lives of worshippers and civilians alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RPG Training Hidden in a House of Worship</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of a mosque\u2014meant to be a sacred place of peace and community\u2014as a training ground for terrorists is a blatant violation of international norms and a moral outrage. IDF troops from the Nahal Brigade made the discovery during an operation targeting areas suspected of housing weapon caches and militant activities. What they found within the mosque&#8217;s walls was a room specifically set up for RPG training, confirming long-held suspicions about the tactical use of civilian and religious structures for military purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Weapons Cache Further Exposes UNRWA&#8217;s Complicity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The soldiers did not stop at the training room. Additional searches revealed a significant cache of weapons, including rifles, grenades, and cartridges. Notably, some of these arms were stored in bags branded with the UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) logo. This discovery raises grave questions about UNRWA&#8217;s accountability and its deep, troubling entanglement with the terror groups operating in Gaza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presence of weapons in UNRWA-labeled bags reinforces the argument that this organization, under the leadership of General Philippe Lazzarini, functions as more than just an aid provider. Time and again, it has been shown to facilitate or turn a blind eye to the activities of terror organizations like Hamas, allowing them to manipulate aid channels and use humanitarian cover to conduct and expand their military capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IDF\u2019s Commitment to Civilian Safety Amidst Complex Warfare</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation in Jabalya underscores the complex reality Israel faces in defending itself. The discovery of a training room for RPGs inside a mosque, surrounded by weapons disguised under humanitarian labels, showcases the strategic use of civilian and religious sites by terrorists to shield their operations. It highlights the moral and strategic challenges of conducting military operations while striving to protect civilian lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first instance where military assets were discovered hidden in places meant to be off-limits under the rules of war. The IDF continues to expose the tactics of Hamas and its affiliates, whose actions not only threaten Israeli citizens but also put Gazan civilians at grave risk by making them targets when militant assets are hidden among them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">UNRWA: The Need for Reform and Oversight</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>UNRWA&#8217;s association with such finds cannot be overlooked. The repeated uncovering of weapons stashed in UNRWA-labeled supplies or facilities must push the international community to hold it accountable. What is required is more than just a reassessment; it\u2019s a decisive shift in how global organizations operate in conflict zones to ensure that aid and neutrality are not being exploited to facilitate terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This discovery calls for immediate international attention and action. The use of mosques as training centers and the involvement of an organization like UNRWA in facilitating such activities underscores a critical need for a reevaluation of humanitarian practices and oversight in Gaza. The world must confront the reality that terror groups deliberately violate all boundaries of decency and legality, using places of worship and humanitarian cover as shields for their operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel&#8217;s defense forces, while conducting operations that expose these truths, face the immense challenge of balancing effective defense with the protection of civilians. This balance is made increasingly difficult by the tactics of groups that operate without any moral constraints, risking the safety of their own people to achieve their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-id=\"18514\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-02-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18514\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-02-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-02-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-02-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-02-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-02.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-id=\"18513\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-03-1024x682.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18513\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-03-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-03-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-03-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-03-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1112-03.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n",
