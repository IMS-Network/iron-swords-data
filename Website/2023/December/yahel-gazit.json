He was a captain in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), serving as the deputy company commander in the 53rd Armored Battalion. He fell in battle on December 4, 2023, during fierce combat in Sajaiya, Gaza, at the age of 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yahel had a deep passion for music and writing. A year and a half before his passing, he co-founded the band &#8220;White Noise&#8221; with his childhood friends Omri Shlissel and Yam Goldstein. Together, they recorded their first album, which includes singles like &#8220;Twenty&#8221; and &#8220;My Fall,&#8221; the latter of which became hauntingly significant after his death. According to Omri, Yahel was the kind of person you dream with, and they had shared a vision of creating music together from a young age. Music was not only a creative outlet for Yahel but also a way for his friends and family to keep his spirit alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to his musical talents, Yahel was also a prolific writer. After his death, his parents discovered more than 100 poems and songs he had written, each reflecting a mature and unique perspective on the world. One of his most poignant works, <em>&#8220;Every Home Needs a Person&#8221;</em>, was set to music and performed by Israeli singer Danny Robas as part of the &#8220;Armored Corps Remember&#8221; project. The central theme of the song, which highlights the human need for a home and a home\u2019s need for a person, resonated deeply in light of the ongoing conflict and displacement of families in Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yahel\u2019s sensitivity and leadership extended beyond his creative pursuits. He was deeply respected as a commander in the army, leading his soldiers with both strength and empathy. He had a natural ability to connect with those around him, providing hope and support, especially during the intense warfare in Gaza. His mother, Miah Gazit, a psychologist, initiated the memorial project &#8220;Or Ki Yahel&#8221; (Light that Shines), offering free mental health treatment to Armored Corps soldiers, inspired by her son&#8217;s legacy of caring for his comrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before his death, Yahel had also experienced personal loss. In August 2023, his father Amos passed away after a long battle with cancer. Yahel had dedicated the last months of his father\u2019s life to caring for him. Despite this heartache, Yahel remained focused on his military responsibilities and his artistic endeavors. His older brother, Ido, serves as a company commander in the Nahal Brigade and received the news of Yahel&#8217;s death while engaged in heavy fighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in his final moments, Yahel demonstrated his unwavering commitment to his country. On October 7, 2023, despite no longer being part of his battalion, he voluntarily joined his comrades in the fight to free besieged kibbutzim in southern Israel. He sustained an injury during the fighting but refused to stay home, returning to the front lines shortly after a brief rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yahel&#8217;s loss is a profound one, but through his music, writings, and the memories shared by those who knew him, his light continues to shine. His legacy serves as a reminder of the profound impact one person can have on the lives of many, even in the face of unimaginable tragedy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"guten-element guten-video guten-Eqbx0s\"><div class=\"guten-video-wrapper\" data-property=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/Yt9o-nigFs0&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;guten-video-background&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;100%&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;500px&quot;,&quot;controls&quot;:true,&quot;playsinline&quot;:true,&quot;style&quot;:{},&quot;config&quot;:{&quot;youtube&quot;:{&quot;playerVars&quot;:{}}}}\"></div></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Yahel</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Gazit</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">24</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">04 December 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">188th Armored Brigade</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Captain</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
