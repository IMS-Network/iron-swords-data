This is in line with the agreement reached with the US, Egypt, and the UN.</p>\n<h2>Recent Humanitarian Aid Deliveries</h2>\n<p>Yesterday, (Dec. 30) 4 tankers of cooking gas designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza entered the Gaza Strip. Additionally, a second water pipeline from mobile desalination facilities situated on the Egyptian side of Rafah was successfully established. This initiative, led by the United Arab Emirates, aims to provide clean water access to approximately 150,000 people.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, 24 solar panels designed for the operation of medical refrigerators by WHO entered the Gaza Strip. Tens of thousands of vaccines also arrived in the region.</p>\n<h2>Temporary Pause for Humanitarian Aid Movement</h2>\n<p>Today, (Dec. 31) between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Al-Jneina camp in Rafah to enable the movement of humanitarian aid.</p>\n<h2>New Field Hospital in Rafah</h2>\n<p>A field hospital in Rafah operated by the Red Crescent is expected to begin treating patients in the coming days. With a capacity of 50 beds and a personnel of 120, the hospital includes 6 intensive care units and 3 operating rooms. Additional field hospitals are in the process, expected to be operational in the coming days. More equipment and personnel for field hospitals have also entered the Gaza Strip.</p>\n",
