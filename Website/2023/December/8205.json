There is a military way to do this, the beginning of it is also what you are doing here, to strike, to deter, to kill Hezbollah activists, to demonstrate our superiority, and it can come also in the form of attack and attack and war, and it may be that over time it will take other periods and other solutions, because we are focusing between the arenas on other things.<br />\nThe State of Israel never took and said war is the first solution we will try, but we understand that in this situation, it needs to end with a very clear change in the situation. And yes, something very difficult happened that tells us there are cases when it is right to use this tool, in its full power. We use it in Gaza, I don&#8217;t want to say full power, but very strong forces and also with beautiful achievements&#8221;.</p>\n",
