His courage and commitment led him to the front lines in Gaza, where he made the ultimate sacrifice. Refusing to retreat, Joseph upheld his principles with honor, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and dedication to his country.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Family Life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph was born on April 18, 1998, in the United States to Larisa and Jacob Gitarts. He was one of five siblings, with brothers Ida, Ze&#8217;ev, Michael, and Assaf. At a young age, Joseph moved to Israel, and despite the challenge of language and cultural adaptation, he embraced his new home with determination. His family recalls his deep love for them, his intellectual curiosity, and his drive to excel in every area of his life. His brothers fondly remembered his knack for asking endless questions, always seeking to understand the world around him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His connection with his family was profound, and this bond shone through in the letter he left for his parents, which was discovered after his death. In it, he expressed his gratitude for the life he lived and reassured them that his decision to fight was made with conviction and without regrets. He urged them to find strength and positivity even in their grief, emphasizing the importance of supporting Israel and embracing the joy of family, particularly their grandchildren.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military Service and Heroic Sacrifice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph Gitarts enlisted in the IDF reserves on October 8, 2023, just one day after the Iron Swords War broke out. His sense of duty was immediate and resolute. Assigned to the 7029th Battalion in the 179th Brigade as a tank operator, he quickly became known for his professionalism, tactical intelligence, and unyielding spirit. His commanding officer, Captain Yonatan Blank, described Joseph as the most dedicated tank operator he had ever worked with\u2014a soldier who constantly sought to improve his skills and perform his duties with the utmost precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 25, 2023, Joseph&#8217;s tank was struck by an anti-tank missile in the southern Gaza Strip, and he was killed in action. Even in his final moments, his actions were a testament to his bravery. He had the opportunity to avoid the frontline but chose to stand by his comrades, embodying the values he held dear\u2014courage, loyalty, and a commitment to defending his nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the letter he left behind, Joseph wrote poignantly about his acceptance of his fate, stating, &#8220;I could have chosen to hide, but that would have gone against everything I believe in.&#8221; His words resonate as a powerful declaration of his dedication to his people and his principles, reflecting his belief that his sacrifice was for a greater cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Professional Life and Personal Achievements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond his military service, Joseph was a talented and ambitious individual with a passion for learning. He pursued scientific work in the fields of medicine and computer science, blending his intellectual curiosity with a desire to create meaningful advancements. In the year leading up to his untimely death, Joseph had embarked on developing a startup, showcasing his entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph\u2019s dedication to his professional pursuits was paralleled by his drive in the military. Even within the confines of his tank, he found ways to nurture his love for reading, cleverly splitting thick books into sections to fit them inside. This creativity and persistence in seeking knowledge exemplified the kind of person he was\u2014a thinker, a doer, and a man constantly pushing the boundaries of his capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Legacy of Honor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph Gitarts&#8217;s life and legacy are marked by his profound sense of duty, his courage in the face of danger, and his unwavering love for his family and his country. His words to his parents\u2014&#8221;I fell with honor for my people; I have no regrets&#8221;\u2014encapsulate the essence of his character. He faced the harsh realities of war with his head held high, driven by a deep sense of purpose and an unshakeable belief in the justice of his cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At his funeral, held at the Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery, his brothers and fellow soldiers paid heartfelt tributes, highlighting Joseph&#8217;s relentless determination and the inspiration he provided to those around him. His brother Ze&#8217;ev spoke of Joseph\u2019s remarkable journey from a young immigrant struggling with Hebrew to a dedicated soldier who earned the respect of his peers. Captain Blank, his commanding officer, promised to honor Joseph&#8217;s memory by continuing their mission, ensuring that his sacrifice would not be in vain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph Yan Gitarts will be remembered not only as a hero who gave his life for Israel but also as a beloved son, brother, and friend. His legacy is one of courage, intellect, and an unwavering spirit that inspired all who knew him. As his family and comrades continue to grieve his loss, they also carry forward the values he stood for\u2014love for Israel, dedication to duty, and a profound sense of purpose. His memory will live on as a beacon of what it means to live and die with honor.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Joseph</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Gitarts</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">25</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">99th Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Sergeant first class (res.)</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
