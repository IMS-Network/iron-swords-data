Some of the discovered tunnel entries connected to strategic assets of the terrorist organization Hamas through an underground network. In addition, many kilometers of tunnel paths have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>The openings were located in civilian areas, and many were found near or within buildings such as educational institutions, kindergartens, mosques, and playgrounds. In some of the tunnels, the IDF discovered several weapons left inside. These findings are further proof of the cynical use that the terrorist organization Hamas makes of the civilian population as a human shield, and as a cover for its terrorist activities.</p>\n<p>After the discovery of the tunnel openings, IDF forces conduct a comprehensive research activity to understand the characteristics of the tunnels and then prepare the underground path for its destruction.</p>\n<p>Attached is evidence of the detection and destruction of tunnel openings by IDF forces: https://bit.ly/47LGH4o.</p>\n",
