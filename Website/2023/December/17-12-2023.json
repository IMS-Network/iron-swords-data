        "rendered": "<h1>Increased Humanitarian Aid to Gaza Starting December 17</h1>\n<p>Starting today (Dec. 17), UN aid trucks will undergo security checks and be transferred directly to Gaza via Kerem Shalom, to abide by our agreement with the US. This will increase the daily volume of humanitarian aid entering Gaza and being delivered to the people of Gaza.</p>\n<p>Yesterday (Dec. 16), 90 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred to the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing. Additional equipment and personnel for the UAE and Jordanian field hospitals entered the Gaza Strip. On the same day (Dec. 16), four tankers of fuel and two tankers of cooking gas designated for the operation of essential infrastructure in Gaza, have entered the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<h2>Humanitarian Aid Operations</h2>\n<p>Today, (Dec. 17) between 10:00 and 14:00, the IDF will pause operations in the Al-Idari neighborhood in Rafah in order to enable the movement of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid, including only food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment, is routed to Egypt and then forwarded to undergo Israeli security screening at either Nitzana or Kerem Shalom Crossings. From there, UN aid is sent to the Gaza Strip via Kerem Shalom, while the rest is sent to Gaza via the Rafah Crossing in Egypt. The volume of humanitarian aid is determined, among other factors, by the ability of humanitarian organizations within the Gaza Strip to absorb the aid.</p>\n<h2>Medical Response</h2>\n<h3>Field Hospitals</h3>\n<p>With a capacity of 41 beds and a personnel of 154, the Jordanian hospital has treated over 500 patients, while the United Arab Emirates field hospital, with a capacity of 200 beds and a staff of 100, has treated over 150 patients.</p>\n<h3>Treatment Abroad</h3>\n<p>In coordination with Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey, the ill and wounded are transferred to Egypt, the UAE, and Turkey. So far, 758 ill and wounded have exited the Gaza Strip for treatment in Egypt, the UAE, and Turkey, along with 480 escorts.</p>\n<h2>Tactical Pause Updates</h2>\n<h3>Dec. 16</h3>\n<p>The pause took place in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah.</p>\n<h3>Dec. 15</h3>\n<p>The pause took place in the Western neighborhood in Rafah.</p>\n",
