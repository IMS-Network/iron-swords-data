However, her life took a tragic turn early one morning. <br>As the weekend duty officer, she was supervising the base when it came under a sudden and violent attack by Hamas militants. About 20 minutes into her shift, which began just before dawn, the base was assaulted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eden Alon Levy was a young soldier who served as a squad commander at the Zikim Military Base near the Gaza Strip border. <br>At 19 years old, her leadership and bravery were evident, particularly on October 7th, when she played a pivotal role in a fierce battle at the base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With remarkable calmness and decisiveness, Eden acted swiftly to secure the safety of her fellow soldiers. <br>She instructed a new recruit at her side to alert others and organize a retreat to protected areas. Tragically, during this heroic defense, Eden was fatally wounded, but her actions undoubtedly saved many lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home in Nir&#8217;it, a communal settlement in southern Sharon, Israel, her family awoke to alarms and distressing messages from Eden, initially not realizing the severity of the situation. Her last words to them were expressions of love, sent just minutes before she was struck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eden was remembered not just for her military valor but also for her vibrant life outside of service. <br>She was an avid dancer, participating in a representative dance group of southern Sharon from the age of eight. Her leadership qualities were evident both in and out of uniform, influencing and inspiring all who knew her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her loss was profoundly felt by her community and her family, who described her as a joyous and determined individual, always striving for perfection and deeply committed to her roles, whether on the dance floor or in military service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her honor, the project &#8220;Levachot Lachem&#8221; facilitated a meeting between her mother, Inbar, her sister, and the singer Keren Peles, who performed a song that resonated with Eden&#8217;s story, celebrating her life and bravery. This initiative, supported by Mifal HaPais, emphasized the healing power of art and culture in times of grief and loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eden Alon Levy&#8217;s legacy is marked by her courage, strength, and the profound impact she had on those around her, both in her life and through the circumstances of her untimely death.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"OJMRbw\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-OJMRbw layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-DPtvUo\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"DPtvUo\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"1HSYK6\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-1HSYK6 layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-kvRqDc\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"kvRqDc\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-GRFHn6\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-CJJ69p\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"CJJ69p\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9mt9hQ\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-VOvYMy\">Eden</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-ZaEIHF\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-TsQrIF\">Alon Levy</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-ihnH0N\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-3xoWWH\">19</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9vFkpu\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">07 October 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rA57zS\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2rSaB3\">Search and rescue</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Uh3Dfi\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-VRaQCC\">Staff sergeant</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-bBdcgJ\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
