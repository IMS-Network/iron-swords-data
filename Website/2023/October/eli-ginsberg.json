Born on September 28, 1981, in Kibbutz Misgav Am to Chaya and Michael, Eli\u2019s life was marked by his service to Israel, his deep commitment to his family, and his love for his community. A decorated combat officer in the Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, Eli served his country with distinction for 23 years, rising to become the commander of the LOTAR Counter-Terrorism Unit. Tragically, he fell in battle on October 8, 2023, fighting to protect Israeli civilians during the Iron Swords War, as he led the defense against the massacre in Kibbutz Be&#8217;eri.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Family Life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eli Ginsberg\u2019s life was anchored by his love for his family. He is survived by his wife, Malki, and their four children: Mika (15), Uriya (13), Razi (8), and Tamari (5). Malki, who had tragically lost her first partner, Staff Sergeant Erez Ashkenazi, also a Shayetet 13 fighter, found a new life of joy and resilience with Eli. Together, they built a life filled with hope, warmth, and shared dreams in Kibbutz Dovrat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one day before Eli&#8217;s untimely death, he and Malki celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary, reminiscing over old photos and imagining a future full of possibilities as Eli prepared for civilian life. The joy they shared that evening was a precious moment that stood in stark contrast to the chaos that would soon follow. Malki remembers watching Eli sleep peacefully on the couch, filled with gratitude for their life together and the adventures they had planned. &#8220;We were going to conquer the world together,&#8221; she said, recalling how Eli was set to embark on his long-dreamed trip to Thailand with their family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military Service and Heroic Sacrifice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eli&#8217;s military career began in 2001 when he joined the IDF, becoming a dedicated member of Shayetet 13, one of Israel\u2019s most elite naval commando units. His journey through the ranks was marked by his unwavering commitment, courage, and exceptional leadership skills. He participated in several critical operations, including the raid on the Gaza flotilla, demonstrating his tactical expertise and bravery under pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Eli was appointed as the commander of the LOTAR Counter-Terrorism Unit, where he led with a combination of strategic vision and a deep sense of responsibility for his soldiers. As a commander, he was not only a leader but also a mentor and a father figure to his troops, known for his compassionate yet firm approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, Eli was officially on leave, having just completed his military service. Yet when news broke of the attacks on the southern Israeli communities, he didn&#8217;t hesitate. Despite being in the midst of his transition to civilian life, he instinctively knew where he needed to be. Eli quickly gathered his gear, even struggling to find his stored uniform, and raced to join his comrades in the field. His wife, Malki, had tried to convince him to stay, reminding him that he had already given so much to his country, but Eli was resolute. &#8220;It&#8217;s the call of duty,&#8221; he told her as he left for battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eli fought bravely on the front lines during the battle to stop the massacre at Kibbutz Be&#8217;eri. He led his unit in clearing houses and rescuing families, his actions saving countless lives. As he joined forces with fellow Shayetet 13 soldiers, his life was tragically cut short in a fierce engagement with Hamas militants. Eli&#8217;s final act was one of pure heroism, a testament to his lifelong dedication to protecting his homeland.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community and Legacy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond his military achievements, Eli Ginsberg was a pillar of his community in Kibbutz Dovrat. He was more than just a soldier; he was a friend, a leader, and a role model. He volunteered as the head of community security and initiated the creation of a community sports committee, fostering a spirit of togetherness and resilience among the residents. His joyful spirit, dedication to helping others, and commitment to strong values left an indelible mark on everyone who knew him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eli&#8217;s former commander once recalled a moment that captured his dual nature perfectly: &#8220;We were on patrol near the Gaza border when Eli received a call from his wife and kids. Instantly, the tough commander transformed, speaking to them in a tender, childlike voice. That\u2019s who Eli was\u2014a warrior on the battlefield and a loving father at home.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal Achievements and Dreams</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eli&#8217;s dream was to explore life beyond the military, to travel with his family, and to indulge in his hobbies like woodworking\u2014a passion he had put aside for years due to his service. He had meticulously planned a trip to Thailand with Malki and their children, followed by a solo journey to India, something he had always envisioned as his &#8220;post-service adventure.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His family describes him as a man who lived life with purpose and joy, whose dreams were always about creating more happiness for those around him. He was a supportive husband who helped Malki realize her dream of opening a fitness studio, a devoted father who cherished his time with his children, and a friend who was always ready to lend a hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Tragic Cycle of Loss</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The tragedy of Eli Ginsberg\u2019s death is compounded by the eerie parallel to Malki\u2019s first love, Erez Ashkenazi, who also fell in combat in Gaza two decades earlier. Eli and Erez were not only comrades but also close friends who served together in Shayetet 13. The bond they shared was a bridge that connected past and present for Malki, who has now experienced the unimaginable heartbreak of losing two partners to the same conflict, two decades apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malki&#8217;s words capture the essence of her grief and resilience: &#8220;This is not the life I imagined, but it&#8217;s the life I have. My children and I will go on, because that&#8217;s what Eli would want us to do\u2014live fully and never let go of hope.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lieutenant Colonel Eli Ginsberg\u2019s story is one of extraordinary courage, selflessness, and an unyielding dedication to his country and his loved ones. His legacy will live on in the lives he touched, the soldiers he led, the community he served, and the family that carries his spirit forward. His sacrifice in the Iron Swords War stands as a poignant reminder of the human cost of defending one&#8217;s homeland and the undying commitment of those who choose to serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eli&#8217;s name will forever be etched in the hearts of his family, friends, and all who had the privilege to know him. He was a hero in every sense of the word\u2014a warrior, a leader, a father, and a husband who gave everything he had for the safety and future of Israel. May his memory be a blessing and an inspiration to us all.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Eli</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Ginsberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">42</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Al-Marom Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Lieutenant colonel</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
