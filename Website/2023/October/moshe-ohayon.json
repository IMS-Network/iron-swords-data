Despite the initial safety of a shelter, Moshe&#8217;s unwavering concern for his neighbors drove him to action, leading him to break open nearby shelters to provide refuge for those in need. With courage in his heart and his personal firearm in hand, Moshe confronted the terrorists head-on, risking his life to defend his community. In a daring act of bravery, he thwarted the assailants&#8217; attempts, eliminating one and engaging in a fierce firefight with others.
