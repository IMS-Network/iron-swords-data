He was the youngest of four siblings, growing up alongside his sisters Noa and Asaf and brother Yoav. From a young age, Itay was known for his joyful spirit, ever-present smile, and deep love for his family and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Education and Personality</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Itay was a bright and caring individual who was deeply involved in his community. He was an active member of the &#8220;Bnei Akiva&#8221; youth movement, where he grew into a natural leader. His kindness, humility, and willingness to help others left a lasting impact on everyone he met. Itay was the kind of person who would always go out of his way to lend a hand, whether at home, with friends, or in his broader community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military Service</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 6, 2020, Itay enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), where he served in the infantry. His dedication, courage, and strong sense of duty led him to join the elite Duvdevan Unit within the Commando Brigade. As a Staff Sergeant, Itay was known for his bravery and selflessness, qualities that made him a respected and admired soldier among his peers and commanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Tragic Events of October 7, 2023</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, during the Hamas-led massacre at the &#8220;Nova&#8221; music festival near Kibbutz Re&#8217;im, Itay was attending the festival when the attack began. Instead of fleeing the chaos, Itay chose to stay and help. He immediately started assisting the wounded, applying tourniquets and evacuating people from the danger zone. Despite the extreme danger and the advice to leave the area, Itay continued to provide aid to those in need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, Itay was killed while helping others. His final moments were a reflection of the selfless and heroic person he was. Itay&#8217;s actions during those harrowing hours saved many lives, but ultimately, he paid the highest price. He was 22 years old when he fell.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legacy and Remembrance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Itay Yehudah Bausi was laid to rest at the civil cemetery in Kvutzat Yavne. His family, friends, and community remember him as a beacon of light, love, and joy. Itay was not only a hero in his final moments but also throughout his life, as he consistently put others before himself and touched the lives of many with his kindness and generosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Itay was passionate about helping at-risk youth, a cause he dedicated much of his time to, even camping with them for an entire year. His love for animals, especially his dogs, and his dream of building a simple, happy life with his girlfriend were central to who he was. Itay&#8217;s plans for the future, which included a trip to Thailand after his release from the army and a simple life filled with love, were tragically cut short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Itay\u2019s mother, Juliana, and his girlfriend, Carmel Ripstein, have shared stories of his bravery and compassion during the attack, emphasizing the profound impact he had on everyone around him. Itay\u2019s life was a testament to the power of love, kindness, and selflessness, and his memory will continue to inspire all who knew him.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Life of Heroism</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Itay Yehudah Bausi was a hero not only in his death but throughout his life. His selfless actions on that fateful day are a powerful reminder of his commitment to helping others, even in the face of unimaginable danger. His legacy of kindness, bravery, and love will live on in the hearts of his family, friends, and all those who were touched by his life.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">itay </h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">yehudha bausi</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">22</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">07 OCTOBER 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Duvdevan</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Sergeant first class</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
