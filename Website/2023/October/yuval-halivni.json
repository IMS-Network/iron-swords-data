He grew up in Moshav Misgav Dov and attended the &#8220;Gderot&#8221; primary school before completing high school at the regional school named after Y.H. Brenner in Kibbutz Givat Brenner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a young age, Yuval was passionate about sports, excelling in tennis and basketball, playing for Hapoel Gderot from third grade through high school. He was an avid sports fan, particularly of Hapoel Tel Aviv\u2019s soccer team, which he regularly attended with his father and younger brother. Yuval&#8217;s enthusiasm for sports extended beyond playing, as he was deeply knowledgeable about various sports and athletes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Music was another one of Yuval&#8217;s passions. He played drums, piano, and guitar, even joining a local band and composing songs. His musical taste was eclectic, ranging from metal and hip-hop to pop and Mizrahi music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuval was also deeply involved in the Israeli Scouts. He joined the Gderot tribe in fourth grade and became a beloved leader, known for his compassion, values, and ability to see and appreciate every individual. His peers and younger scouts admired him for his warmth and idealism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, Yuval embarked on a three-month mission as part of the &#8220;Friendship Caravan&#8221; on the East Coast of the U.S., showcasing Israeli music to Jewish communities. It was during this mission that he met Amitee, his future wife. Their love was instantaneous and enduring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Yuval participated in a year of service in Bat Yam, working with young Jewish volunteers from abroad to support underprivileged communities. Following this, he spent a summer in New York at Camp Tel Yehudah, where he mentored Jewish-American youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2013, Yuval enlisted in the Israeli Air Force\u2019s pilot course but later transferred to the Maglan commando unit in the infantry. He excelled during his training and fought in Operation Protective Edge (July\u2013August 2014). He continued to stand out in his military career, graduating from several courses with distinction and serving as the unit&#8217;s navigation officer and then as a deputy company commander. His comrades described him as the glue that held the team together, known for his leadership, kindness, and unwavering optimism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After five years of military service, Yuval was discharged but remained active in the reserves, serving as an operations officer in an elite reconnaissance unit. His dedication and professionalism were highly regarded by his superiors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following his military service, Yuval traveled with Amitee to New Zealand, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. Upon their return, they settled in Givatayim and later moved to Ramat Gan. Yuval pursued a degree in management, political science, and international relations at the Open University while working at several companies, always committed to the welfare of his colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2020, Yuval married Amitee in a small wedding due to COVID-19 restrictions. A year later, they celebrated with a larger event. Their son, Yonatan, was born in late 2021, and Yuval embraced fatherhood with tenderness and joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, during the surprise Hamas attack on Israel, Yuval was called to reserve duty. He was deployed to the Sderot area as an operations officer, coordinating preparations for battle. On October 9, during a pursuit of a terrorist cell, Yuval was ambushed and killed along with two other soldiers. He was 30 years old, just two weeks shy of his 31st birthday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuval was laid to rest in the military cemetery in Gderot, leaving behind his wife, son, parents, brothers, and sister. His wife, Amitee, eulogized him as her lifelong partner, who had always been there for her, saving her life just months earlier during a medical emergency. His mother, Nirit, mourned the loss of her beloved son, and his twin brother, Ziv, spoke of the unique bond they shared, expressing the deep void Yuval&#8217;s death left in his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuval&#8217;s legacy of kindness, leadership, and love continues through his family and friends, who honor his memory by organizing monthly nature hikes in his name, fulfilling his desire to &#8220;complete with the place.&#8221; He is remembered as a hero who fell defending his country, saving the lives of others, and leaving an indelible mark on all who knew him.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"SGEabL\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-SGEabL layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-narrow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-kauciS\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"kauciS\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-divider guten-element guten-divider guten-SjMhFb\"><div class=\"guten-divider-wrapper\"><div class=\"guten-divider-default guten-divider-line guten-divider-regular\"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">social media</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icons guten-qFDqos rounded horizontal fill\">\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icon guten-5P4r0D instagram\"><a id=\"guten-5P4r0D\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/together_with_yuvali/\"><i class=\"fab fa-instagram\"></i></a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icon guten-F4SfFu facebook\"><a id=\"guten-F4SfFu\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/people/\u05d1\u05d9\u05d7\u05d3-\u05e2\u05dd-\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9/61557039897204/?mibextid=ZbWKwL\"><i class=\"fab fa-facebook\"></i></a></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Yuval</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Halivni</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">30</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">09 October 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">551st Brigade</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Captain</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
