        "rendered": "\n<p>Eden Abdullayev was murdered by Hamas terrorist in Kibbutz Ra&#8217;im while attending the &#8220;Nova&#8221; Festival</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon realizing that terrorists had infiltrated her surroundings, she attempted to flee and sought refuge in a shelter. <br>Unfortunately, contact with her was lost at 9:38. After an arduous five days of searching, Eden&#8217;s family received the devastating news of the identification of her body.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IbBkh7\">Life Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Eden, the eldest daughter of Hana and Avi, was born on October 8, 2000, into a family that had immigrated to Israel a few years prior. She grew up in Ramat Gan, attended &#8220;Ramat Hen&#8221; elementary and &#8220;Blich&#8221; high school, and was known for her joyous spirit, empathy, and social skills. Eden had a passion for music and dance, showcased in her elementary school years and continued into her youth with a love for hip-hop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After serving in the IDF in the finance unit, Eden started her pre-academic studies and worked as a waitress in Tel Aviv, where she became part of a new friend circle. Despite the tragedy of losing her father to cancer in October 2022, she found solace and support in her family and friends, which helped her return to her vibrant self. She enrolled in a business administration program, looking forward to her future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2023, Eden traveled to a music festival in Athens, showing signs of happiness and recovery. However, during a festival near Kibbutz Re&#8217;im, on October 7, 2023, a day before her 23rd birthday, Eden was murdered by Hamas terrorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eden&#8217;s loss was deeply mourned by her family and friends, who remembered her as a beacon of love and joy. She was laid to rest next to her father, leaving behind a legacy of warmth and resilience. In her memory, her loved ones have engaged in various acts of remembrance, including a memorial weekend and a crowdfunding project to continue her legacy, emphasizing her giving nature and the light she brought to everyone&#8217;s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NS5PoP\">Social media</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icons guten-kF7oQB rounded horizontal fill\">\n<div class=\"guten-element guten-social-icon guten-vxwcfq instagram\"><a id=\"guten-vxwcfq\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/remember_eden/\"><i class=\"fab fa-instagram\"></i><span></span></a></div>\n</div>\n",
