Noam and Alma were released on November 25th, and Liam was freed on November 29th. The kibbutz announced on May 2nd that Dror had also been killed on October 7th and his body taken captive to Gaza. Yonat, a respected entrepreneur and interior designer, owned her own carpentry shop and home design business in Be\u2019eri, called Ayuna, which had earned national acclaim. Described as kind-hearted and peace-loving, she leaves behind a legacy of creativity and warmth.
