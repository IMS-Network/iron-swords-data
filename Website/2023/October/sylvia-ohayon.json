        "rendered": "\n<p>Sylvia Ochayon, the daughter of Esther and Makhlouf Ochayon, was born in Dimona, Israel on August 13, 1964. She was the eighth of nine siblings, with older siblings Georgette, Deborah, Danny, David, Nurit, Shimon, and Ilah, and a younger sister, Dalia. Sylvia grew up in a tightly-knit family environment, attending the &#8220;Afikim&#8221; elementary school in Dimona, which she walked to each morning with her siblings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite facing numerous challenges, Sylvia never felt deprived. Her father, Makhlouf, valued education and believed that his children would receive the best schooling in kibbutzim. When Sylvia was 13 and struggling in her local middle school, it was her turn to move. She moved to Kibbutz Be&#8217;eri, which she quickly came to regard as a paradise, and she was adopted by Mordechai and Meira Neveh there. Despite the relocation, her bond with her sisters remained strong, with frequent letters exchanged to coordinate weekend and holiday gatherings at their parents&#8217; home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sylvia served in the Israeli military as a communications and encryption operator, where she earned the nickname &#8220;Sulti&#8221; after a humorous misunderstanding involving her second name, Sultana, which was her grandmother&#8217;s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After her military service, Sylvia became deeply involved in community life and various sectors of work at Be&#8217;eri, showcasing her exceptional talents in cinema, arts, and organizational skills. She took on a significant role in film production after taking courses at &#8220;Camera Obscura.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1997, Sylvia became a mother to Eden, whom she raised almost single-handedly with the support of the kibbutz. She made sure that Eden maintained a connection with her father and his new family, teaching her daughter everything she believed in and always being there for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sylvia was active and health-conscious, enjoying swimming and cycling, and yoga became a central part of her life. She started a yoga teaching course, which she did not complete. Her radiant smile, generosity, and love for life touched everyone she met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, on October 7, 2023, during a sudden and brutal attack by Hamas on Israel, Sylvia was killed in her beloved home at Kibbutz Be&#8217;eri. The assault claimed the lives of over 90 members of the kibbutz and many were taken hostage. Sylvia&#8217;s family was devastated, receiving confirmation of her death after an agonizing week and a half of uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sylvia left behind her daughter, siblings, a large and loving extended family, and countless cherished memories and stories that continue to bring comfort and laughter to all who knew her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p></p>\n<cite>This summary is based on the article found at <a href=\"https://laad.btl.gov.il/Web/He/TerrorVictims/Page/Default.aspx?ID=43580\">Israeli Ministry of Defense &#8211; Terror Victims</a>.</cite></blockquote>\n",
