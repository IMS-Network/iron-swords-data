Eitan Mor worked as a security guard at the Nova Festival and was kidnapped by Hamas. Eitan is the eldest of eight children of Efrat and Tzvika Mor. His youngest sister is four years old. Eitan lives in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem, has a loving partner, and a dog that is very close to his heart. In regular times, he works as a barista at a caf\u00e9 on Bezalel Corner in Jerusalem, where his picture is displayed \u2013 until he returns. He dreams of opening his own restaurant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eitan spoke with his parents a few minutes before the Sabbath. On the morning of October 7th, Eitan spoke with his uncle because his parents observe the Sabbath. One of the survivors of the Nova massacre said he saw Eitan, together with his good friend Eliakim Liebman, moving the bodies of young women to a safe place. While performing this sacred task, moving the bodies of women away from the murderers who might desecrate their honor, the two were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists. Perhaps this act, just before the kidnapping, tells something significant about Eitan&#8217;s character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact with Eitan was lost around 2:00 PM, and he was considered missing for many days. Eitan&#8217;s family and friends searched for any lead until an officer came and informed the family that Eitan had been kidnapped to Gaza. </p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
