He grew up alongside his siblings, Oz and Lior, in a loving and supportive family. From a young age, Sagi displayed a deep commitment to helping others and a strong sense of duty, which would later define his life and career.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military Service and Heroism</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, Sagi, was called to action as Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on southern Israel. <br>As a Major in the reserves and a commander in the Counter-Terrorism Unit (LOTAR), Sagi led his team into the heart of the battle in Kibbutz Be\u2019eri. In the intense battle that ensued, Sagi displayed extraordinary bravery, rescuing and evacuating dozens of trapped families. His selfless actions saved many lives, but tragically, Sagi was killed in the line of duty on October 8, 2023 (23 Tishrei 5784). His heroism in battle led to his posthumous promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal Life and Legacy</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagi&#8217;s life was one of dedication and love. He was engaged to be married to his partner, Omer Ohana, just one week after the fateful day he was killed. The couple had meticulously planned their wedding, choosing the song &#8220;Zakhiti Le\u2019ehov&#8221; by Ivri Lider to accompany them down the aisle. Heartbreakingly, Ivri Lider would later sing this song at Sagi\u2019s graveside during his funeral, a poignant reminder of the love and life that was lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagi was not only a courageous soldier but also a kind-hearted and inspiring individual. His friends and family describe him as a talented and humble man who excelled in every endeavor. Whether as a top student, a decorated officer, or a caring friend, Sagi left an indelible mark on everyone who knew him.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Historic Legacy</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of Sagi\u2019s death, his partner, Omer, and his mother, Eti, fought for Omer&#8217;s recognition as Sagi\u2019s widower. Their efforts led to a groundbreaking change in Israeli law, allowing same-sex partners of fallen soldiers to be recognized as widows or widowers. This legal milestone ensures that Sagi\u2019s legacy of love and commitment will continue to impact the lives of others, even after his passing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagi\u2019s father, Gilad, has spoken publicly about his son\u2019s bravery and dedication, urging others to cherish their loved ones while they can. Sagi&#8217;s life was a testament to the power of love, duty, and sacrifice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Resting Place</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagi Golan was laid to rest with full military honors at the Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery. He leaves behind his partner, Omer, his parents, Eti and Gilad, his siblings, Oz and Lior, and countless friends and comrades who will forever remember him as a hero. Sagi\u2019s memory lives on as a beacon of courage and love, inspiring future generations to live with the same sense of purpose and dedication that defined his life.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">sagi</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">golan</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">30</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\">08 october 2023</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Marom Division</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">major</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
