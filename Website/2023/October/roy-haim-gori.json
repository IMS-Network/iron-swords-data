Growing up in the warm and loving environment of his family in Ofakim, Roi was a bright and cheerful child, known for his constant smile and infectious energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being born prematurely, weighing only 1.4 kilograms, Roi quickly caught up with his peers. From the moment he learned to walk, he was driven by a strong desire for independence and exploration, often seeking out the outdoors where he loved to play and burn off his abundant energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adventurous spirit and love for the extreme, along with his quest for independence, characterized him throughout his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Education and Early Influences</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Roi elementary education at the state-religious school &#8220;Noam Morasha Yeshurun,&#8221; and continued his studies at the Torah-Scientific Yeshiva &#8220;Shvilei Eitam&#8221; of the Amal Network, where he attended both middle and high school. He was a sociable and well-mannered boy, always bringing joy and optimism to those around him. His analytical mind and natural talents made him an excellent student, while his dedication to sports led him to develop a strong and muscular physique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his time in the &#8220;Bnei Akiva&#8221; youth movement, where he was both a participant and later a counselor, Roi learned the value of contributing to others. He dedicated much of his time to volunteering, including working at a summer camp for children at the &#8220;Neve HaRo&#8217;eh&#8221; village in Ashkelon, where he formed a special bond with one of the campers. Roi&#8217;s acts of kindness, both at home and in the community, became a hallmark of his character. His sister recalled how he would always be present to offer help, often noticing a need and stepping in with ease and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military Service and Heroism</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Roi, like many of his peers, was passionate about serving in the IDF and was determined to make a meaningful contribution to the defense of his country. He intensified his physical training as his enlistment date approached and was thrilled when he was accepted into the prestigious &#8220;Golani Brigade Reconnaissance Unit.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After enlisting in the IDF on March 21, 2022, Roi completed a rigorous training program and earned the &#8220;Tiger&#8221; badge of the Golani Reconnaissance Unit. His commanders and comrades described him as a brave and determined soldier, always the first to volunteer for any mission and possessing an unwavering sense of duty. His high level of maturity, responsibility, and emotional intelligence made him a natural leader, and he was soon identified as a candidate for officer training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a squad commander, Roi was known for his ability to balance the demands of leadership with the necessary sensitivity. He provided both spiritual and mental support to his soldiers during difficult times, motivating them to serve with a strong sense of purpose. His soldiers admired him deeply, often seeking his guidance and considering him the best commander they had ever had.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Life of Service and Sacrifice</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 7, 2023, the Palestinian Hamas went on a murder &amp; rape campaign in Israel, marking the beginning of what would become the Iron Swords War.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roi was at home on a break from the army when the attack began. Hearing gunfire outside, he and his older brother Ariel ran outside to confront the Hamas terrorists. Although Roi was unarmed, as his weapon was stored at the base, he refused to let his brother face the danger alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, the brothers drew the attention of the terrorists, allowing others to escape. Tragically, both Roi and Ariel were shot and killed in the firefight. Roi was 22 years old at the time of his death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His sister-in-law, who witnessed the events, described how Roi, despite being unarmed, ran towards the gunfire to protect his brother.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legacy and Remembrance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Roi Haim Guri was laid to rest with full military honors at the Ofakim Military Cemetery, alongside his brother Ariel Raphael Guri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His family, friends, and community remember him as a person of incredible kindness, bravery, and dedication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His sister spoke of the light he brought into the world, his gentle soul, and his unyielding courage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In memory of Roi and Ariel, a Torah scroll was dedicated to a synagogue in Ofakim, and a large graffiti mural was painted in their honor. Roi is also commemorated on the &#8220;REMEMBER&#8221; platform, where stories, eulogies, and photos keep his memory alive. His close friend, singer Eliad Sharabi, wrote and recorded a song in his memory, sharing Roi&#8217;s legacy with the world through social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roi&#8217;s life was one of deep commitment to his family, his faith, and his country. His story is one of heroism and selflessness, and he will be remembered as a role model and an inspiration to all who knew him.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-1Xd8RO\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"1Xd8RO\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"uxLb9c\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-uxLb9c layout-fullwidth align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-BcvNAD\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"BcvNAD\">\n<div class=\"section-wrapper\" data-id=\"D1RzGC\"><section class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-section guten-element guten-section guten-D1RzGC layout-boxed align-stretch\"><div class=\"guten-container guten-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-E9m9gW\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"E9m9gW\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-image guten-element guten-image guten-bLjj9P\"><div class=\"guten-image-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"gutenverse-image-box-filled\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/candle.png\" height=\"3558\" width=\"1192\"/></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-column guten-element guten-column guten-VBiLav\"><div class=\"guten-column-wrapper\" data-id=\"VBiLav\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-XIlfJ6\">First Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-9MST9I\">Roi</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rbIszp\">Last Name</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-0y9ag8\">Haim Guri</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-IDcGkf\">Age</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Nu61ku\">21</h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-fbm6aB\">Fell On</h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-oiInFM\"><code>07 OCTOBER 2023<br></code></h5>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-wePmlX\">Army Unit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-Ukrykc\">Golani Brigade</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-2D7lb5\">Army Rank</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-NbiMeg\">Staff Sergeant</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-gutenverse-heading guten-element guten-rhvrRc\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05da</h2>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd-\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9-683x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6670\" srcset=\"https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd-\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd-\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd-\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd-\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://iron-swords.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9-\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd-\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9.jpeg 1066w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n</div></div>\n</div></section></div>\n",
