A prodigy from a young age, she quickly mastered Hebrew, astonishing her teachers with her ability to read before her peers. Her insatiable curiosity and determination led her to pursue a rigorous academic path, earning three degrees from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, culminating in a PhD in Biochemistry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lilia&#8217;s professional journey was marked by her role as the head of Molecular Biology at Amai Proteins, a startup dedicated to developing a sweet protein to serve as a sugar substitute. Her colleagues and the company\u2019s founder, Dr. Ilan Samish, remember her as a genius, a visionary thinker, and a dedicated researcher who was always eager to learn and innovate. Her work was driven by a deep sense of purpose\u2014to contribute to a healthier, better world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond her professional achievements, Lilia was a loving mother to her six-year-old twins, Tamar and Dekel. She balanced her demanding career with her family life, always ensuring that her children and loved ones felt her care and presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lilia&#8217;s love for science extended into her personal life, where she shared a passion for science fiction with her father, David. Just days before the tragic event, David had gifted her a TARDIS-shaped necklace, symbolizing their shared love for &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221; and the idea of exploring the universe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lilia attended the Nova Festival with friends. As the morning unfolded, Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on the festival-goers. <br>Despite the chaos, Lilia managed to reassure her parents, telling them not to worry, that she was on her way home. Tragically, she never made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lilia was not only a pillar of her community and workplace but also a beloved figure whose absence has left an indelible void in the lives of those who knew her. Her legacy continues through the work she began at Amai Proteins, where her colleagues have decided to name the next protein variant in her honor and dedicate the laboratory she led to her memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lilia\u2019s life was one of passion, intelligence, and an unwavering commitment to making a positive impact on the world. She is remembered with love and admiration by her family, friends, and colleagues, who continue to grieve the loss of a remarkable woman taken too soon.</p>\n",
