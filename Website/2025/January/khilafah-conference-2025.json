This event represents a dangerous assault on Canada\u2019s democratic principles and public safety. Hizb ut-Tahrir, an international Islamist movement banned in numerous countries, openly promotes terrorist ideologies, including the rejection of democracy, the embrace of jihadism, and the establishment of a global Islamic caliphate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event&#8217;s agenda, under the guise of religious discourse, includes incendiary topics such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>\u201cNationalism and the Regimes &#8211; Frontline Enemies of Islam\u201d</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cThe Colonialist Powers: Busting Myths and Erasing Our Fears\u201d</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cOnly the Khalifah Will Liberate Palestine\u201d</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cDespairing in the Victory of Allah (SWT) is Forbidden &#8211; Trusting in Him is an Obligation\u201d</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These themes are not only provocative but deliberately designed to sow division, foster radicalization, and glorify terrorism. The speakers, including Abu Omar, Malik Abu Luqman, Bilal Khan, and Dr. Gelani, are known advocates of terrorist ideologies. Their rhetoric consistently rejects secular governance, promotes authoritarian religious rule, and encourages violent confrontation under the pretext of religious obligation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hizb ut-Tahrir: A Conveyor Belt for Terrorism</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hizb ut-Tahrir, or the \u201cParty of Liberation,\u201d is notorious for serving as a &#8220;conveyor belt&#8221; for terrorism. While it publicly denies direct involvement in violence, its ideology has radicalized countless individuals who have gone on to commit acts of terror. Banned in numerous countries for spreading hate, the organization uses events like this conference to amplify dangerous narratives that undermine societal cohesion and public safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing such an event in Canada is an affront to our nation\u2019s democratic principles. It puts Canadians at risk, regardless of their background, and threatens the freedoms and values we hold dear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why This Event Must Be Stopped</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>It Promotes Terrorism:</strong> The conference glorifies jihadism and calls for the rejection of democracy, a cornerstone of Canadian society.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It Undermines National Security:</strong> Events like these serve as recruitment hubs, radicalizing attendees and encouraging hostility toward Canada and its values.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It Endangers Public Safety:</strong> By providing a platform for hate-filled rhetoric, the event fosters division and risks inciting violence.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Must Be Done</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada cannot stand idly by while terrorists gather on our soil to spread their toxic ideology. Immediate action is required:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Shut Down the Event:</strong> Municipal and federal authorities must intervene to cancel this gathering and ensure that no terrorist organization uses Canadian venues to spread hatred.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Investigate Hizb ut-Tahrir:</strong> The organization\u2019s activities must be thoroughly examined, and its operations in Canada scrutinized under anti-terrorism and hate speech laws.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Take a Stand Against Terrorism:</strong> Our leaders must demonstrate zero tolerance for radicalization by publicly condemning this event and the dangerous ideologies it represents.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Silence Is Complicity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing this conference to proceed would be a failure of leadership and a betrayal of Canadian values. Silence in the face of terrorism is not neutrality\u2014it is complicity. Canada must send an unequivocal message: there is no room for hate, division, or terror in our society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stopping the Khilafah Conference 2025 is not just about protecting Canadians today; it is about safeguarding our democratic principles for generations to come. This is a fight for the very soul of our nation, and we cannot afford to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-zeever-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4300bc83d6edfb138897fbd763ef9d06\">Every Canadian has a role to play in opposing terrorism. <br>Stand up, speak out, and demand action from our leaders. <br>Together, we can protect Canada from those who seek to tear it apart.</h2>\n",
