Cloaked in the language of human rights, their real mission is clear: to delegitimize Israel and pave the way for its destruction, aligning themselves with the goals of Hamas&#8217;s charter\u2014a charter that explicitly calls for the murder of Jews worldwide and the obliteration of Israel through jihad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This group hides behind claims of &#8220;raising awareness about the occupied territories&#8221; through so-called &#8220;firsthand reporting,&#8221; but their actions betray them. Their so-called &#8220;truth&#8221; is nothing but a front for spreading Hamas propaganda, translated into Hebrew and spoon-fed to the Israeli public. They deliberately amplify Hamas&#8217;s lies under the pretense of protecting human rights, ignoring the blood on Hamas&#8217;s hands and the horrors inflicted on innocent Israelis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an annual funding of over 3 million shekels, they work tirelessly to delegitimize the state of Israel. Every statement, every action, and every shekel they spend is geared toward undermining the Jewish state&#8217;s right to exist. They promote Hamas&#8217;s narrative daily, fully aware that this narrative is the backbone of a genocidal ideology\u2014one that led directly to the atrocities of October 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be crystal clear: by parroting Hamas propaganda, they endorse Hamas&#8217;s brutal actions. The October 7 massacre, where Israeli families were slaughtered, children were raped, and civilians\u2014including babies\u2014were abducted, is part of what they ultimately support. They cannot deny it. Their messages, their leaders, and their members all stand complicit in supporting and legitimizing terror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking the Occupation in the Eye doesn\u2019t fight for justice\u2014they fight to destroy the very foundations of Israel, all while aiding and abetting those who revel in terror and death.</p>\n",
