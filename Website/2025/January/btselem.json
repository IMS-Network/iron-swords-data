This organization, awash with foreign funding from anti-Israeli sources, exists for one purpose: to dismantle the state of Israel from within. It operates with a clear agenda to delegitimize Israel and undermine its ability to defend itself, making it a direct threat to the nation&#8217;s survival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While B\u2019Tselem made token efforts to condemn the October 7 massacre, their actions and publications tell a very different story\u2014a story riddled with propaganda against the state of Israel and its defenders, the IDF. The IDF, the most moral army in the world, is repeatedly smeared by B\u2019Tselem in narratives that align disturbingly well with the rhetoric of Palestinian terrorism. This organization is not about human rights; it is about empowering those who commit atrocities against Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B\u2019Tselem claims to advocate for the rights of &#8220;Palestinians,&#8221; the same &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; who orchestrated the barbaric October 7 massacre, slaughtering families, raping women, and abducting innocent civilians. These same &#8220;Palestinians&#8221; continue to perpetrate daily terror attacks against Israelis\u2014attacks that B\u2019Tselem conveniently ignores or justifies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B\u2019Tselem\u2019s behavior is not far removed from that of a terrorist organization. They peddle Hamas-aligned narratives, destabilize Israeli society, and serve as a propaganda arm for those who seek Israel\u2019s destruction. Their funding sources, which include anti-Israeli foreign entities, only further highlight their agenda: to delegitimize, weaken, and ultimately destroy the state of Israel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This organization must be held accountable for its actions. It poses a direct threat to Israel\u2019s security and sovereignty, and its members should face consequences for their role in supporting terrorism and inciting against the state of Israel. B\u2019Tselem is not about human rights\u2014it is about destroying Israel, and it must be stopped.</p>\n",
